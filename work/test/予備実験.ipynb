politicking that the question is are we getting anything good done.\n","It's like this whole school issue.\n","and, and it all seems, you know, like everybody's trying to one-upmanship on everybody else\n","Well, there's been a lot of publicity lately about that new Nancy Reagan book out by, uh, Kitty Kelly, the unauthorized biography.\n","Well, I, the reason why I was thinking about looking at it is because it's supposed to,\n","and so it's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it.\n","but that one just sounded like gossipy.\n","And you have so many out there that, uh, that you, you know, you never get a chance to read.\n","something's excellent about them, whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material they were written, you know, that was written about.\n","it seems like, uh, older people have much better, uh,\n","in their schooling, they, they got more of the classics than I did,  you know.\n","Uh, I think that there's a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage books.\n","probably you read a book review or something.\n","A review on it.\n","And, uh, and those are really helpful I think in helping, um,\n","It's handy.\n","it's like school,\n","you have to work at it.\n","Well, I think that's good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things.\n","It's not like, uh, most television where you, you know, you just, you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but,  still understand what was going on.\n","that, television, it gives you everything.\n","So, it's basically mindless.\n","I mean, all your, the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you, you know,  what you're hearing and your, your uh, your sight.\n","But they give you everything else.\n","And it's usually, the television that we see nowadays seems like that it's, it's, it doesn't even have some of the underlying, uh, things to it, you know, that maybe the old movies and things had, you know, the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out.\n","Or, you know, like with Hitchcock or something where you're, you're, you're either expecting something or\n","but I really, I really get mad at myself when I do, because I I realize fully there's no really redeeming value for,  T V.\n","Well, I think it is good to, to read books and, and, because even if it's, like you say, it's light reading, you are still getting some, uh, mental exercise\n","You're developing your imagination.\n","You know, when you develop your imagination, that can take you into a lot of other areas, because you've developed, uh, your, your, your mind in, in seeing things, you know,  even if it's your own set way, you know,\n","it's, you're, you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind.\n","So, I mean, It's, it's excellent.\n","I mean, even if you haven't got a, a a human friend around, you can pick up a book and, and,  be with somebody, basically.\n","I, I just, I think, the sanctions would have worked,\n","but it would of taken longer\n","so, uh, been a different turn,\n","and then I don't think we projected what was going to happen after the war,\n","It got over so fast,\n","And so it seems like there's, you know, always some body digging things like that.\n","But, I'm not for sure we know exactly what, what all happened in that situation,\n","So, we were so, uh, fast to get over the Vietnam, whatever the Vietnam syndrome is, that now we've tied ourselves up there in the Middle East for a long period of time.\n","I just think, I think if we had been very, I mean if we had that good of a correlation through the United Nations, then they could have, uh, they could have made sanctions work, I'm pretty sure.\n","With that much support, you would have just penalized any nation that broke the embargo,\n","I think we're very naive as far as that part of the world is concerned.\n","in, in, we've just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bad with the wrong fellow for the next, next tenure, for the next thing down the road\n","and, uh, then, we can, and we don't tend to read Israel correctly\n","it should be a mess.\n","It's, uh, not going to be anything we're going to get out of very soon.\n","In spite of all the promises.\n","They can talk a good game,\n","we just, if we do find so-called experts in any area of the world, we don't listen to them\n","be, be interesting to keep watching I guess,\n","but I'm just afraid it's going, it's going,  to break us.\n","And I'm not sure we're sensitive to, to other cultures.\n","Not very much in our colleges,\n","we're trying,\n","and, and cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand\n","and it needs to be, uh, taught from the earliest grades,\n","with our school systems in such disarray, I don't know, if that, it doesn't look terribly hopeful.\n","But I'm not sure it's something you can teach.\n","I mean,  awareness.\n","Well, you can at least, uh,  give them the awareness of the different cultures and, uh, you know, have all sorts of, um, at least, you know, let them know what that, that other people do things differently than, than, than maybe in their own neighborhood.\n","So, and when, when, when those people are around\n","and you can get them to meet\n","and we're all pretty much alike,\n","So, uh, But it's, uh, it's something as, you know, as I said won't go away,\n","so it will be a good topic for me in the class for along time\n","Well, I would just think if Bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war, then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the United Nations to, uh, uh, somehow persuade those nations to give the Kurds a homeland\n","they were promised that .\n","Well, that's the same thing,\n","they, uh, they haven't been waiting quite as long, even though they've been waiting since forty-eight,\n","uh, that, that becomes a different matter simply because your dealing with Israel\n","and they seem to be more intractable than ever.\n","Uh, that Shamir can't, can't retain his leadership if he, if he backs down the slightest bit\n","so, uh, I just don't see us, I don't think there's anybody of, of major stature on the scene of, like the great statesman of the past,\n","or at least we thought they were.\n","I'm not for sure that they were.\n","They seem to have gotten us into some of these messes.\n","Well, I wish we could stay out of it,\n","but the oil is not going to allow us to.\n","We absolutely need that oil.\n","That's the major thing.\n","If we didn't need the oil and if we didn't have the ties with the Israelis, we could probably stay out of it.\n","But I'm not for sure that we're not destined, at least for the foreseeable future, as long as we can keep our head, our own head above water, to be the world leader.\n","So I, Bush is probably, if he can keep that correlation together, especially the French, and the British, and the Germans, and be sure that the Japanese can kick in some of their money.\n","They may just have to,\n","I don't know what type of pressure they can put on all the nations there, too, because now that the war is over, societies have just about gone back to their own,  uh, uh, cold selves.\n","they, uh, they're, nobody likes them in that part of the world\n","but, uh, it's just such a volatile area,\n","I mean, there's just no stability, period.\n","because,  I mean, we really don't, I mean, I don't think, it's our world to westernize the whole world,\n","so the fact that the Saudi could just sort of pull back and, uh, remain, you know, culturally sort of clean is interesting.\n","I, it's not our, uh, role to make everybody like us.\n","But, it's just, uh, for those who have, may have wanted to travel in that part of the world that are up in the age I am, it's going to eliminate that for awhile.\n","I think it's going to be too dangerous to be any place in there.\n","it's just totally gone to, uh,\n","I think we're terribly taxed.\n","I, I think the Republicans have taxed us just as much as the Democrats,\n","and I don't think there's a change between one party than the other.\n","Uh, I think we get a lot back,\n","but not as much as we should.\n","Uh, I guess what I feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it, there's got to be something.\n","When, when we pay so much for the, for the debt, instead of using the money for where  it ought to go, it, it's just, it's ridiculous.\n","they kept doing, they kept putting off doing that.\n","That's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together.\n","well I think they spend too much.\n","They, they spend too much on themselves, too,\n","the, the, A lot of the, the taxes gets back to the members of the Congress and everything all running for twenty years, rather than.\n","well. Things like mailings.\n","They don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things.\n","They just think once they get there that they can do just anything.\n","And of course, here at home, we end up conserving and conserving\n","I think, uh, it is the Congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money, uh,\n","The national debt is terrible.\n","There are a couple of things I think we need to really work for,\n","But I think we need to have the one line, uh, uh, veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything.\n","If it's a good idea  it can be done again.\n","You know, and if it's not, so what.\n","At least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months.\n","and it was ridiculous, you know, the whole thing\n","And they do things that are, you know, just like the, uh,\n","that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on.\n","And the trouble is, you don't, you have so little input about it.\n","You don't know  enough to know what, what to do about some of this stuff.\n","They're supposed to do what we say,\n","but they do what they, they want to do with it.\n","The other thing about is I think, uh, limiting their time in office would be good.\n","We need to get that through.\n","We, we have said that, I've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two two terms is enough for all of them.\n","Uh, whether you're mayor, all the way up, city council, the works, I think. Certainly President, that, uh, two terms is plenty.\n","And then we get these professionals out of there,\n","and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves, you know, rather than  living off of us.\n","wouldn't that be too bad\n","I think, uh, people in general,\n","the, the, the idea of what you need to, to exist is so outrageous that it's not  hardly.\n","You know, it starts at the courts,\n","it starts everywhere until we can't, we've just lost control of, of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, you know.\n","Well, it's so much money\n","and you can't even add it up, you know,\n","you can't even,  can't even conceive of what they're talking about.\n","that's why they think,\n","when you talk about the trillions of dollars on this and that.\n","the other thing is, it's, it's all very well to give money to help people, other people,\n","and I think we need to do that.\n","But there are, they need to put more limits on them.\n","They need to restrain  about what they do.\n","Foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it's absolutely necessary.\n","They, they've given that away for fifty years.\n","I, I, you know, I think that's probably, unless we can afford it,\n","if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again.\n","but you, you need to get rid of this thing that's, that's just, uh, eating us up you know, and get things on a, on an even,\n","if it were, if it were a family, we'd be up before the, the magistrate for, for doing all these wicked things, you know,\n","but the government does it,\n","and it's all right.\n","I, I know we're taxed to death on every, every thing.\n","but, uh, they don't even talk about that.\n","They just raise it.\n","They don't even consider it, like you saying  to cut something back, you know.\n","They are at least doing something now, with the, the military, you know,\n","but of course, now, you know T I,\n","you know that's hurting us but although,\n","it's good to see them doing some things there anyway.\n","But T I has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else.\n","And if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic, uh weapon systems.\n","I think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens, we're going to have to bite the bullet.\n","And we're all going to have to do it.\n","I, it just isn't fair, though, that when this happens in some places, it needs to all come off everywhere.\n","They need to put that into into action and show they mean business. That they've got to cut, they've got to cut costs.\n","The only taxes I think that are well spent,\n","But uh, I think that paying for school, schools is the, schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime.\n","But, um, you know, it, you just feel like it's out of control.\n","You feel like  they do not have control of it.\n","The spending is out of control.\n","And that, and so then it just aggravates you, you know,\n","you think, I could spend my money,\n","I, I think that's a wide open subject what you said.\n","People need to take a stand.\n","I think the people will here shortly, uh.\n","If they don't do, if they don't, if they don't pull it in and start doing something, I think they're really going to have to I think.\n","I think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out, too, that, what they did last election,\n","and, uh, ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in, you know,\n","so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes, you know.\n","They're supposed to represent us.\n","That's what they're called\n","but they don't.\n","May, may, may, maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there, guys and gals whatever they are.\n","in some ways we're awful lucky I guess.\n","But still, you don't want it to get that bad, good heavens.\n","you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be.\n","we need to get, try to get hold of it and, and have it be, things be honest\n","Well I think one of the good ones in the metroplex, uh, in the last say twenty-five years or so, maybe longer, they've built all these dams.\n","we've had good water supply,\n","The state actually did some good, good work on that, in that a couple of years ago.\n","And they, they really had done some good, some good work.\n","I think anything for water supply like that.\n","California should do more of that too.\n","there are a lot of places where they're in real trouble,\n","and and I think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too, if they don't take, if they don't take that early stand.\n","and they need to start another one.\n","I think every time they finish one they ought to just have  another one in line.\n","The water's critical.\n","The growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait until something til they need them.\n","because that's just dollars right out of the franchise.\n","They're consistent.\n","Now they kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and, uh, course, uh, all the people that follow the Lakers and everything out there in, in California.\n","Uh, and it also helps when they were winning\n","Well, they play better as a team than anybody else, seems like.\n","I think they do really play much better as a team than they do, uh, uh, each one, you know, individually at their spot\n","year in and year out, it's not like they have, you know,\n","a lot of teams will, will, will win in the playoffs\n","and then the next year they'll be all they'll be too busy doing their endorsements and stuff, to, to concentrate on the game.\n","and I think they're really giving them a run for their money.\n","I guess it's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy.\n","I mean they're sleeping in different bed every night\n","and and I imagine that really helps his back.\n","He ought to have his own bed come along with him, you know\n","because it's, it kind of a violent game.\n","Some of those guys got pretty funny looking, uh, eye wear.\n","But, uh, he's got to be way up there.\n","God. That's a, that's a lot\n","That's a lot of, a lot of guy coming down on you.\n","I think Boston, Boston will win.\n","those guys really hang tough.\n","They really, uh, they really gave some, some really good years of, uh, uh, of enjoyment and fun and everything.\n","Basketball's gotten to be a lot of fun.\n","Oh, uh, Bangladesh, boy, they, they caught it bad\n","Kind of wiped them\n","But we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes.\n","Wiped everything out.\n","That would have been something.\n","It's really strange the way it does that.\n","Especially the way it starts.\n","Uh, the main point that I have about choosing where you want to go to school, is that, you have to early on define what it is you want to do or at least what area you want to be in.\n","people are getting pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues.\n","make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education\n","and save specialization, I guess, for graduate school, unless they're sure they want, early on they want to do something like engineering or something.\n","and that's a pretty good engineering school, I think.\n","I think we do some  they have pretty good engineering here.\n","people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here, which I think is wonderful.\n","That would,  be very good actually.\n","And it's,  that's not even true in our colleges.\n","you, you don't need any philosophy at all in school.\n","or, or, or, or some other thought provoking area, you know.\n","But I believe that, that, that you, one of the, one of the best things to do, at least for me in school was, was, I was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses.\n","Well, that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school.\n","It, it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier.\n","Well, vicarious learning is a wonderful thing.\n","It certainly means that we don't have to experience everything,\n","but experience is a wonderful, teacher also.\n","Or probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing.\n","And I think that varies.\n","I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child.\n","Um, you know, it's, it's, once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's, you know, really, really qualified per se.\n","Um, with a, with a baby, definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency.\n","and, um, coming from, you know, that background and the background as a parent now, I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a, a lot of times baby-sitters,\n","it's, you get somebody where you kind of know the family already.\n","And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions.\n","but there again she, you know, she knew, knew of your family,\n","and she, and she met in a safe setting, such as church.\n","So she was going on those two instincts.\n","So, I mean people are so different.\n","Um, you know, you, you learn a lot by going in there\n","and they they explain to you, you know, what their day consists of and what their general rules are,\n","You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers you know, that have done this over and over again.\n","Um, I think lots of people, I, I think I went by location for one thing.\n","I think most people do that.\n","I think you start out with the criteria of, you know, do I know of anything\n","there is , I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth.\n","And then, you know, I mean, even at that you have to consider the logistics of it.\n","You know, I mean, you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north. even if that's the best one in the whole wide world\n","So there, there are just so many considerations.\n","Uh, I think as long as you plan your basic foods,\n","course, for a dinner party, you fancy things up a little bit more.\n","and down here, sea food is pretty expensive, because, you have to ship it a long way to get it\n","and it's not as good as if it's fresh.\n","well they do in the summertime,\n","I think that tea is big in the summertime mostly.\n","Of course, you have warmer weather most of the time.\n","it never gets real cold.\n","They have a lot of vegetable to them,\n","and, uh, they really are very good.\n","That probably makes it easier,\n","Oh, those always go good.\n","and, uh, they are real easy to cook\n","Well maybe. that's good the way, way the things are going.\n","I think it's the texture of it,\n","but it takes more chewing\n","Children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers, and that,\n","and it is easier to chew.\n","that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever, you, uh, like best.\n","that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you, because they are grown adults usually\n","and you know they know better.\n","Even if they can't do it, they can always maybe get somebody else to cook .\n","Either, either go ahead and fix your dish\n","or call someone that can.\n","I mean, that sounds like an army.\n","That is an army,\n","Well any number is nice, let me tell you.\n","Well, I kind of decided that single, single children that, that, that's not parenting,\n","that's a hobby.\n","It's not as fair to the children either, I do not think.\n","but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too.\n","and you can spot them, because they have no idea how to hang out and mess around.\n","How to just entertain themselves.\n","It's a problem for any child\n","and you take one that's used to being, uh, busy being, having something to do all the time, it makes a big difference.\n","and I do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home.\n","I think the main thing is to, uh, right now, I think the main thing is to look at what they are interested in. Uh, and take what they are interested in,\n","and then, then start looking for schools.\n","And there's nothing wrong with that, you know, if,\n","college is not for everybody.\n","But, uh, it, it does make a difference in your wage income.\n","I think it's what they want out of life,\n","because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are, they can make a, you know, a much better income.\n","See it makes a difference.\n","Uh, but I really think it's important to put these children someplace where, in addition to, you know, them getting an education, they really need a, you know, a socialization away from what they are raised in. Especially if you lived a pretty insular community\n","And so, in the long run, if it's really what they want, you know, they are better off.\n","That would be a lot.\n","So, therefore, you really don't have a very long life, you know once you buy it.\n","I thought, so, you know, they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is.\n","And it's something good to have on hand, too.\n","It takes time\n","and you have to rack your brain,\n","And your mess\n","I decided it looks better in BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS than it does in practicality.\n","So you have to have the picturesque kitchen, you know, right out of the magazine.\n","Well, we even have a better one.\n","times goes fast.\n","so I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned.\n","Well, I think that is just wonderful.\n","and so, uh, I think at this point to fit it into, to other things, it's kind of a task.\n","I think that is so wonderful.\n","I think that's really, really good.\n","And, and, you know, I think this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be a routine.\n","Well, I think that's great.\n","They can wait until you get back home.\n","Well, I think that's great\n","this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city.\n","and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long.\n","It goes from hot,\n","and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer,\n","and then it's cold\n","That kind of schedule, you really need a lot more sunshine.\n","Sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler.\n","and you know, it's all relative,\n","and I still think so,\n","It seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern, that's all it does.\n","But then we started thinking, especially in Plano, the weather is so hot in August, that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow.\n","I think a lot of people agree the same.\n","It just really gets way,\n","now there have been worse summers.\n","everybody seems to be,\n","you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat, because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're melting,\n","and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're, it'll be too cold,\n","well those are the ones that like the cold weather.\n","He, he always did such a good job, I thought.\n","It was it was really a shame.\n","A good weather man,\n","He didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did.\n","It's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes\n","And, uh, and I, that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe.\n","It's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day.\n","Oh, I think that's wonderful.\n","And, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a really don't have a place to go.\n","Uh, I think it's wonderful these, these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily\n","and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both, able to do everything for themselves.\n","and, but I think you'd have to really,\n","I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.\n","And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.\n","They never go to see them.\n","maybe, maybe Christmas.\n","You know, um, I, I think nursing homes are, are, um, some are good\n","But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.\n","Or if, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.\n","so maybe we'll get it improved.\n","You know, it's, I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there.\n","And then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, I'm sure that it is just, you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast.\n","that would be devastating I'm sure\n","And, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't, uh,\n","it's a very, very hard decision I think.\n","and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably.\n","and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.\n","And that might be a partial solution, or something.\n","Well, I, I think we kind of are along the same lines.\n","We've covered a little bit\n","and it's not something that is, uh, you know,\n","But I guess we all do.\n","I, that, it just, you know, it's absolutely devastating.\n","Well, they're not, every, all the horror stories you hear about them I think are true.\n","But, again, it's no different than every one.\n","when you think about it, for what you're paying a hospital for almost the same, well, even not as much care.\n","It's not that expensive, really.\n","you, you know, this is the whole point.\n","You've got, you've got to shop them.\n","and I think it'd be more economical if I were able to a smaller car and, uh, wouldn't be, wouldn't cost much with gas.\n","but you know, when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out,\n","and you think, Oh, well, maybe, maybe I would like a new car.\n","Well, the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the\n","That is a pretty car.\n","that's pretty, too.\n","they get pretty expensive.\n","Well, you can't go wrong with that kind of opportunity.\n","Well, you get a much bigger, better comfortable ride.\n","That's, that's unbelievable for that size of car.\n","Well, I think that, uh, you have an excellent deal then,\n","and the, the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair\n","and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all,\n","and I said, I'll never find another one for that price.\n","And they keep going up,\n","So they must be collecting information about who does it, and how often.\n","but I think that's a really interesting question.\n","that, that seems farfetched only because it, it, there's no law that says you have to buy a newspaper or pop cans or milk jugs.\n","So there, there's, it's possible that there is a person in Plano that doesn't buy any of those three things, and therefore wouldn't have.\n","That's true, except that it's hard to imagine, you know, when you have, uh, cans, you know, from the, the market and, uh you know, vegetable cans, and et cetera.\n","Someday I'm sure we'll find out.\n","I think it's a very good thing.\n","I think that, uh, I think it helps if the city is giving you a nudge to do it because I think there are a lot of people that don't do it,\n","and it's interesting, too, that we have to drive, we drive to Plano at Plano Road to, uh, just inside your city limits, to, you know turn them in to dump them in.\n","I'm sure there's bound to be some here in Richardson\n","and I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded, uh, more, uh, of a national defense, uh, than anything else,\n","but, uh, on the other hand, too, uh, people then, uh, needed to use firearms for, um, survival in terms of, uh, food\n","but it's, all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs.\n","it, uh, moving to this area, of course it happens everywhere,\n","but, uh, I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, uh, in the midwest and then, uh, moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings\n","and, uh, there seems like killing for no reason at all,\n","Well, it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was.\n","There's always been a certain amount of crime in your, you know, your urban areas,\n","It's, you know, it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse.\n","I know that it's scary,\n","and that's basically what the gun control would end up being.\n","It's not the law abiding citizen that, you know, is, is dangerous with the gun\n","It's the ones that are going out and stealing it.\n","And I think that would almost have to go with armies, too.\n","I mean, they'd have to be almost world-wide, which we know would never ever happen.\n","Because even if you said, okay,\n","some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck.\n","and, uh, and, you know, uh, I suppose, uh, years ago, way back when, uh, when, uh, they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they, uh, were fed up with the government, uh,\n","and if they didn't have a way to, uh, to fight back they would have been in big trouble.\n","we maybe want to overthrow the government\n","Well, the way things are going.\n","if somebody doesn't do something.\n","and so, I guess it depends, um, if there are some statistics that show that, uh, that people, uh, commit crimes on the spur of the moment.\n","it's kind of both, I guess,\n","but it's not, it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.\n","But, uh, it's just as suspenseful, I think.\n","That, that was cute.\n","that was good.\n","That was, that was pretty good.\n","that was, was really good.\n","Boy we have we, we see all the same movies.\n","They're more interesting.\n","And it's hard to believe that, you know, this really happened.\n","Some of them are pretty bad.\n","Huh. Well We sure do have a lot in common.\n","I, I believe that, uh, the American public and I, as an individual and private citizen have a right to, to bear arms and to have a gun as long as I, uh, am responsible with it and protect the safety and welfare of my kids\n","and, and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it.\n","I think that education with a gun is, is critical and important.\n","Uh, however, I do believe that, uh, guns ought to be maintained and, and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns\n","and in the heat of the moment, they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people,\n","But, I think that there ought to be some control,\n","but I still think that, uh, individuals have a right.\n","Uh, that, uh, that might cool down some tempers.\n","I think a, a one day would be sufficient.\n","The reason I say that is there is an awful lot of people who go to gun shows\n","and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun, if that five day waiting period were in effect, you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show.\n","but they'd just have to mail it to you, I suppose, huh.\n","I think that gun control has come up because there has been some crazies that killed people with guns\n","and I think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault\n","a, a short waiting period would be appropriate to, uh, take care of the heat of the moment type things,\n","but uh, I think banning semiautomatic twenty-two rifles is a, a bit on the extreme side.\n","And a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway.\n","The only purpose for handguns is to shoot people, in my opinion.\n","or you could do it just for fun, you know, kind of like a game,\n","Well, I think that the, the police, uh, or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves,\n","but, the public, I don't know.\n","I think that I should have a right to own a handgun.\n","Not a automatic, semiautomatic.\n","not an Uzi\n","Uh, but I think a person needs a way of defending themselves.\n","I think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country.\n","Now I think what, we made a major wrong turn when we went into the, uh, to the current generation of space craft, the reusable ones, like they are now because they have not proven as reliable as they should have,\n","and I think some of the earlier approaches were much more, uh, much better in many ways.\n","However, uh, you know, we've gained an awful lot from the space program, all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to, uh, some new space age materials, plastics and all that.\n","So I think it's been a good investment.\n","I think, though, that now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the, uh, oh, I don't know, the guilt that we had out of, uh, Challenger,\n","I think maybe we can  pick up and go on now.\n","I don't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives.\n","The space station's where we should go  at this point.\n","Seems like that we've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor\n","and I don't think we should stop,\n","and I don't think we should cut the money.\n","I, I hate to see them just, you know, keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things\n","and, I think they, I think they lose sight of, of probably what they're supposed to be doing.\n","And, uh, It seems like it's that high a percentage.\n","and, you know, with, with Russia, uh, seemingly not going to be as big a threat.\n","Well, it can't afford to\n","Well, maybe I need to run out there this weekend.\n","but the federal one's the big one\n","The Gramm Rudman Act didn't solve the problem.\n","They just take all the money that they say they cut\n","and they spend it somewhere else\n","or they, you know, they pad out their staff, or, you know, spend it in bounced checks at the, commissary,\n","I'm getting pretty, kind of disgusted with the, uh, uh, you know, the fact that they're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step.\n","I mean, first of all, we were, we've already hit the largest deficit, this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever,\n","and, two, a deficit is, I mean, the deficit is only, uh, is, is as far from a balanced budget,\n","you reduce the deficit,\n","you, you're still not, you're still not, you're still overspending.\n","I mean, it's just the amount that you're overspending,\n","and this is, you know, for some reason, the way that the reporting is going on now,\n","it seems like, like the goal is to reduce the deficit to some, you know, still outrageous amount, um,\n","I, I, I think in the long term something is going to have to be done with, uh, sort of the, the, uh,\n","well I mean, it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process, right, that you've got, uh, people, you know, trying to, trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected.\n","And, uh, there isn't any sort of overall accountability,\n","I, I suppose that, that, that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're going to have, is, is, is exposure and information.\n","And I don't know that in general the American people are that interested, you know, to listen to, to as much, uh, uh, you know,\n","I mean, you're going to have to know what people are doing, and, uh, you know, and how, and how, how partisan and how and how self-interested their, their motives are and, and take it to task for it, because it's not going to get solved, you know, if people are still trying, you know,\n","like you were saying you say, you know, hey, we just, you know, we just cut defense,\n","or you can throw in some, you know, some other kind of thing,\n","and, uh, it's a pretty vicious, uh, vicious cycle.\n","Well, I think they should, they should limit the Senate to one term, one six year term.\n","and, and don't let them come back,\n","and, and, uh, keep Congress to, um, two terms of two years a piece\n","and then it'll be overturning\n","and they won't have the same people there all the time\n","and then, all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks\n","and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence.\n","Because that's one of the things, one of the biggest things is that, uh, the fact that they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another, whether it's the oil companies, or the automotive companies, and like the air bag thing.\n","And the oil companies are, really aren't responsible, you know.\n","The Valdez proved that,\n","and then the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything.\n","It should have been done immediately.\n","because in terms of long term, you just got to get people, um,\n","I mean, uh, at one point, at least on a local level, um, going into politics is, you know, what you're doing is, is really trying to serve the community right,\n","I mean, you don't expect to make any money out of it.\n","You know, maybe you gain a little bit of local fame,\n","but, but it's, uh, you put in a lot of work in exchange for that.\n","And I don't have the feeling that national level politicians are, are at all like that.\n","They listen to wherever the money is.\n","And, uh, you know, I think that, that, that the problem with having, you know, junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with, uh, you know, with inept politicians or people who don't know how to deal with it.\n","they're not as efficient,\n","But on the other hand, maybe that's,\n","and when the kids are small, if you going to wait, you don't go out.\n","They won't put up with that.\n","Well, there's a zillion of them.\n","You got one coming.\n","You know, it's just really weird,\n","and I think that's terrible.\n","because it's really, it helps your, if you have good credit, you know, it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a  bigger purchase or something.\n","because if anything ever happens that you do need to, you know, you have excellent credit,\n","why, it really does help.\n","and I think it's more convenient, too, in a lot of cases,\n","well, I think it's better to use credit cards, too, like I say, because there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing\n","and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket, they're going to hit you over the head.\n","even if it's five bucks, even.\n","It just, uh, you know, it just seems like they're, somebody's always watching.\n","and then you know, you can have your card back with pretty good rating, you know, because you can pay fifty dollars, but not, you know  maybe five thousand or whatever.\n","And, you know, some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything you know,\n","I don't know why they don't, unless you have to spend a certain\n","so I don't think that's right.\n","I think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches, you know.\n","I mean it's just a precaution for everybody.\n","and it's only a little bit,\n","but, I mean, it's still something.\n","and so it's, you know, it helps out here and there.\n","Um, it's really weird,\n","so you know it's got to be good for you.\n","But, uh, it does really make you feel good,\n","So, that gives you, you know, lots of exercise.\n","and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape  you know.\n","those are so cute.\n","They are really cute.\n","so if you could get your projects into boutiques, oh, they are wonderful.\n","You could make a lot of money from those.\n","Oh, these little things are so cute, though, you know.\n","Those are darling.\n","and I think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because, right now I'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there\n","but when it comes to, uh, small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quick, quickly, or whatever, or however you want to say it\n","and, uh, the benefits aren't as great when I worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay\n","you got Four Oh One K plans.\n","You have, uh, better vacation plans, uh,\n","you have, just in general, maternity leave plans that kind of thing.\n","Big corporations are able to do that versus small corporations, uh, you know,\n","they just don't have the money or just feel that there isn't the need for it.\n","That's pretty good for, you know, being a, a school district type program.\n","you had your insurance\n","and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a, a very small place.\n","Uh, they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations.\n","and it's, hopefully  will go through.\n","I mean, it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position, sure.\n","Because, uh, salary wise I don't think I'm making as much with a big corporation because I think when you look at big corps or large,\n","I'm talking like hugh companies like Three M, uh, I'm, uh, Honeywell, uh, Texas Instruments\n","You bring it up to the owner\n","and it's like come on, you know.\n","Partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer.\n","And, and, of course, when it's a small corporation, it also wants to expand\n","so that money is spent\n","but, uh, when it comes to telling kids that they have to do, uh, two or three years of service into some kind of community, I don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say, you know, you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen\n","or, you know, in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do.\n","And, uh, I, as far as a high school course, I could see it as, uh, maybe a social, uh, sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program\n","and  to me, that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year\n","but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter, post high school, of community service, I, I'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do.\n","Um. Well, that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to, uh, mandatory.\n","you know, it, they should have, they should have the same rights as anyone else you know.\n","It shouldn't be, uh, anything shouldn't be mandatory, other than, I guess, like, uh, when you come to paying taxes or something like that.\n","Uh, or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe uh, people be more eager to do it.\n","And doing it for a purpose that they want.\n","The other thing is this,\n","I have thought about this on many times when you get these, uh, young troubled teenagers that, uh, don't have like the perspective of, uh, uh, of the community, a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems\n","but there are other people out in the community that may have problems.\n","Then I can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing.\n","You have to do so much as far as in  community service now.\n","If they were, you know, abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse.\n","Or if, uh, they destroyed some property around the, uh, area, then they would have to do, uh, to restore it and perhaps, uh, work, uh, for the community to beautify it or whatever\n","but I could see that working in you know, cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever.\n","so I could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled,\n","Uh, I think they should have more programs like that.\n","And I think, uh, us being taxpayers, we pay for, uh, people that's in jail or in trouble anyway.\n","So they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas\n","But, uh, the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on, uh\n","And sometimes, you know, putting them in jail doesn't really help because there's nothing in there that would rehabilitate   rehabilitate  rehabilitate them\n","and then when they get out, they,\n","because they have this stigmatism of being in jail.\n","And there's a lot of anger, sure. You know, especially if they haven't went through treatment\n","and they dealt with other people in the, uh, system of prisons which, uh, you, you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever.\n","I would say the crimes would probably be, you know,\n","if you went in for a certain crime, there might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have,\n","so you're dealing with people, uh, that may, uh, be an influence later on\n","and, uh, an issue of anger would be is that I went to prison for a year or two\n","or, uh, you know. But then again, those that have physically assaulted somebody, uh, that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in  the community if they're of a violent sort and to say\n","And, uh, it seems that business wise, uh, in the business community, or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family.\n","So, you know, if you do have any time, it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done, uh, just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then, plus try to have that relationship with your children,\n","and it, it's sometimes a very, it, it's a very hard juggling act.\n","And, uh, I know that it, it must be really challenging to, uh, try to juggle a job and, and also your children.\n","And you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults that, uh, the ones that are, are home and the ones even that are at home that are getting the love and attention that they need.\n","it's just a different,\n","they're, they are more use to being with their own age kids\n","they're not use to being with adults and to responding  to adults.\n","Uh, I think the trend in the United States,\n","I feel really bad that it's turned so much  to where the children are, uh,\n","and I thought to myself, how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks,\n","whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work, whether it be six weeks or three or four.\n","But how these women must feel to place their children into care\n","and, you know, it's our society saying yes,\n","It's a little bit financial type thing\n","because, uh, if you look all over in the other countries, like Europe and that, uh, their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are\n","and  that's part of it too.\n","But, uh, like my husband was saying, maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties, uh, were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision, well, jeez, you know, I'll go out and get a part-time job.\n","Got a part-time job\n","and then financially, they got themselves into well, I'll have the boat,\n","and  it's nice\n","and really women, past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too, uh,\n","because it is now, our financial situations are as, it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now\n","It's hard.\n","It really is hard.\n","and pretty soon, you know, you're at the limit where you've got to say okay, you've sacrificed for, you know, so many years at home\n","and you're not getting any further, you know, along\n","and you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go back to work full-time\n","and you have to make that decision\n","and it's a tough one.\n","I think  one of the things that people look at too though, is, uh, how they spend their time with their children\n","I think with working moms, if you can get them the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year-round school where you work,\n","Um, I like the idea of nursing homes as a, as a growing the choices you have in nursing homes now, whereas used to, you used to have only, you put, you know,\n","when, when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves\n","and there was no other choice.\n","You couldn't take them in your own home,\n","then they went into a nursing home.\n","You know, maybe you lived too far away to care for them,\n","or your daily job or whatever prevented it.\n","And then if things deteriorate, they can go to a second level which is, you know, like, where they prepare their meals for them\n","and, and they still live somewhat independently\n","but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals.\n","And then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level, which is full care, you know, where some people can't, where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed,\n","and they can't get around\n","but then they have full care.\n","Um, it's, it's funny\n","so it's really nice to see that.\n","that's some of the things I would find important before I, I would look into that for a person, is, is, is like you're saying, a good mix of people who have the same interests.\n","Because I don't think a lot of people really, even in the nice ones, and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently, they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home.\n","So I think those kinds of things, to make it more homelike and to make it more, um, enjoyable for them. That'd, that'd be one thing I'd look for, along with the, uh, health care aspects to make sure they had, you know, that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses.\n","like whenever they're in, you know, the older people, they're like, um, fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they, you know, they wander the halls. And they get the wrong medicine, just because, you know, the, the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine.\n","And so many of them, you know, are,\n","that's one of the things that, that we don't think about as we get older, and the, the money that it now requires to, uh, be in one of these places.\n","Because some of these people that are just on social security,\n","and if they don't have any living relatives,\n","perhaps they never had children\n","or if their children, you know, passed away before they did they can be in some places that are, you know, that, that are not good.\n","Or they, they have very minimum, minimal care\n","and the, the care that they are getting, the people who are giving it are are paid at a minimum wage,\n","and they just they don't care as much.\n","And, and like you said, they're trying to make it, the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything.\n","That certainly would be something to, to watch for.\n","Because you've got, with some of them being, some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in, .\n","and and sometimes they share a room,\n","and it's just a little cubbyhole,\n","and they share it with another person,\n","and they're still paying that much.\n","It, it, it just sometimes, it just seems ridiculous.\n","you've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care, what kind of level of care you need, and then what you can, unfortunately what you can afford at the same time.\n","Well, like there are other communities, too, that aren't necessarily a nursing home.\n","It sounds like, uh, an apartment or\n","it would be hard to.\n","so it's probably not widely available.\n","Everybody needs some sense of responsibility.\n","An even, even if it's just a little bit.\n","just to keep them going.\n","I don't think I don't think it's right to just put someone in it.\n","I think they would have to agree to go in it.\n","unless they're at a point where they're mentally incapacitated\n","Like you're saying with Alzheimer's and stuff, they're going to be some people who have to be there whether they want to or not,\n","and that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it, when you're, when you're in something like that, that they'll get the kind of medical care they want without, or they need, without overdoing it. Without doing something to make this, you know, to keep, like you're saying, to keep them still to make the staff happy.\n","Well, that's, that's good, too, I mean, as far as entering,\n","I mean, you're, you're participating,\n","but you're not, you know.\n","I mean at least you're encouraging them on and stuff\n","A lot of times the parents get into it just as much as, as the kids,\n","well, that, that would be fun.\n","and, and their Catholic *they're\n","Well that's it then, I think,\n","probably maybe that, that.\n","But it's so expensive, man.\n","it's so, it would be really hard now to have twelve children.\n","I would think for your parents it would be, it would still be hard even nowadays, I mean, just to raise twelve kids.\n","Would be, shoosh.\n","Well sometimes I think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though, you know.\n","I mean you don't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody\n","so you, you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself, if you really want it.\n","how easy it is to blow money you earn.\n","Wow, you've really got responsibilities.\n","if we were in a wreck, you know, you can be sued for anything now.\n","If we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued\n","and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad,\n","and the little kids would have nothing.\n","So really, I think, sometimes there's an advantage,\n","I mean, sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent.\n","It makes you know that you can't take anything for granted that when you get something you're lucky to get it, so to speak you know.\n","but now, it, it is hard, I can imagine, on your parents, you know ...\n","TWILIGHT ZONE rules, man.\n","TWILIGHT ZONE rules.\n","Oh, he just, like, totally sarcastic and hilarious\n","it was awesome.\n","WAYNE'S WORLD was pretty cool.\n","Uh, kind of annoying\n","Kind of annoying to, like, in front of T V, like trying to do homework, you know.\n","Trying to write an essay, you start talking about, you know, like, IN LIVING COLOR or something,\n","B S\n","that's the way to do it.\n","Like, the news we don't watch, because they're boring.\n","I guess they think that people don't watch T V,\n","but I mean if you watch it for, like, five minutes, then it repeats everything over and over and over.\n","It's, like, oh, man.\n","well I used to hate STAR TREK.\n","basketball's cool,\n","but football kind of after a while,\n","it's more spirited .\n","and the actual play time that there is is five minutes.\n","Because by, the play time is when the person, when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the, when the pitcher pitches and it's hit.\n","and that's, like, you know, five seconds for the whole play\n","and that's it.\n","I mean, maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases, you know.\n","they have better computer science up here than they, than they do down there.\n","especially if you get, what is it, Seclor I think that that just about breaks the bank right there.\n","it's pretty bad.\n","The one that's like you get additional,\n","Um, especially when they finish all the construction out here\n","and not only is it, you know, trouble to have to drive, but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving.\n","But that's, that's a nice benefit to have.\n","That's really important.\n","um, if, if an employee is especially exemplary, I think it's often,\n","in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say, Hey, you know, this person did a wonderful job, give him a big bonus kind of thing.\n","A lot of times smaller companies have bonus plans, where I think in a large company it's hard to do that because there're just so many people to deal with\n","and you have to have guidelines, you know, for salary increases, and things like that,\n","that's one of the things that, that happens when someone, when you're dealing with a large company.\n","Well, I was going to say it sounds like you, you picked out a lot of good things, you know, for him, to, to, uh, to choose in a position and have a lot of thought put into it.\n","In a big company, though, you also get moved around a lot\n","you never know.\n","and it is, I think it is important to, you know, want to be close to your family\n","it's nice. It's nice that you can have your family close like that.\n","We have gone more into the business aspect of, like I say, of, I don't know, working more,\n","and we, I think we've even gone into more the labor aspect of it also. With the pay and everything, you know.\n","I feel that, uh, we've missed as far as the top jobs go. You know, the higher echelon.\n","Because if you look at most corporations, there isn't a woman, you know, that's on the board of directors, or that type of thing,\n","they are mostly all men.\n","There may be a few, but very incidental.\n","It's mostly, you know,\n","even if you want to say home, you really can't.\n","You know, it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living,\n","and I don't think raises have kept up with, you know, a lot of the stuff, you know, as far as your medical insurance and just groceries and gasoline and all, you know.\n","and you know, there's a lot of truth to that.\n","If you are not going to have a family, then that's fine,\n","then, you know, a career is a smart choice.\n","And to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it, and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff, you know I, I think that the mother and the child lose,\n","and I think that's why there is so many problems you know, with kids today,\n","because they don't have the family roots anymore.\n","they don't want to take care of the kids. And the house and that kind of thing.\n","That's very true, but then they shouldn't have a family.\n","There is no need to have children if you don't want them.\n","That's fine,\n","that's, that's the freedom of choice.\n","because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent.\n","They won't be a caring parent.\n","Like they won't have that,\n","Or they won't be as good as they could be.\n","they'll feel like it's a job.\n","It's not like something that they really wanted.\n","You know, and I feel that's very important,\n","it really is,\n","and it's too bad because mothers miss out on so much too.\n","So I mean in the sense that we've come a long way,\n","but we've sacrificed a lot to get there.\n","And, uh, I really think that if, uh, like after the second World War when women went to work in factories and all that, that was like out of necessity, because the men weren't here anymore.\n","But then it got to be a point where they got some independence.\n","And they just enjoyed the income, the extra.\n","A man can afford the necessities, a woman affords the luxuries.\n","And now kids at sixteen years old, they have their birthday,\n","they get a car.\n","We really have,\n","You will take better care of that,\n","and you will prize that possession. More than someone handing something to you.\n","And it's just like college too,\n","I think that if a kid goes to college, and you can help them, fine, but I don't think you should pay the whole way.\n","but I'll bet your values are a lot higher, you know, and your self esteem and the, the way you, uh, you know, think about things is probably a lot more common sense than these kids that don't have that responsibility.\n","they probably don't even have any.\n","Well, if they do, they don't know it, you know\n","because, you know, a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and stuff,\n","but it's because you've been there. And no one can tell anyone anything\n","you know, you are going to find out for yourself,\n","but I mean I don't think you should just not listen to advice, even if you don't take it, just listen.\n","You know, there is no harm in that, whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid, you know. Just attention, you know.\n","Actually I think abortion is going to take a turn where there is not going to be as many,\n","because I think contraceptives are going to be more popular.\n","I mean I realize that they are popular now,\n","but I think, I really think people are going to start using more contraceptives\n","and with the abortion, I don't think there is going to be as many abortions, but I don't know what women will do when they get into politics, you know, about abortion.\n","I think it will be freedom of choice.\n","Well, I still think people have a choice.\n","You know, if you can live with it, and it's, you know, your conscience is clear then I mean all of us are going to answer to it one day, maybe. Or maybe not.\n","I mean no one has said for sure, you know.\n","And different circumstances call for different things.\n","I guess, you know, the thing really isn't over.\n","They, uh, they had, uh, kind of, uh, I don't know if you call it standout or whatever\n","but anyway they stopped and waited to see if Iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though.\n","As I understand it, from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the U N, uh, had set up, you know, the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all, unless they're just absolutely forced to.\n","So, I guess, from what I understand the thing could just it could just, they could take off at any moment without, uh, you know, you know, any local, you know, congressional effort or anything else because, you know, it's not really settled yet.\n","there just hasn't been any peace over there ever In thousands of years, of history.\n","And it just, it's just not people\n","and it's not, uh, you know,\n","there isn't any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves.\n","And they fight with each other\n","and they have such hatred for, uh, Israel\n","The, uh, the thing that's kind of interesting about this,\n","there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace.\n","and that I'm afraid that we would have to stay.\n","The thing, uh, the other thing too, when this all started if you, you know, if you did much reading on the thing, you know, Kuwait, the country of Kuwait was just, you know, somebody's uh,\n","you go back to World War I when the, uh, Ottoman empire broke up and the British and the French and the, yeah, the British and the French mostly decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia and part of it Iraq and part of it something else, you know,\n","and they, they split things along, um, geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into, uh, social or cultural things at all.\n","So, the country of, of Kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense except that it is an excepted place, you know\n","it's like any other country, you know,\n","for whatever reason it's, it's actually there.\n","Well, Iraq has had, uh, designs on that place since nineteen twenty-two\n","so, you know, it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up.\n","And it's just that this was an excuse, you know, to make some noise\n","Now, something that I read in the paper the other day that I thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab, uh, uh, their version or vision or whatever the United States, now, is somewhat changed in that we won, you know.\n","Now, now we are a, uh, a legitimate player, in the game over there, you know,\n","I don't think we can really understand their attitude because there cultures are just so much different.\n","But, uh, we are now a legitimate player in the, in the, in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we, you know we defeated,\n","you know Iran couldn't do it in seven years\n","and we went in and did in seven days what Iran couldn't do in seven years, you know.\n","that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit.\n","It makes us more legitimate.\n","So, now what they're saying is that, well, since we won whatever we say goes because it's, uh, a kind of a might make strike sort of attitude about it\n","and, you know, we've got the power. Which is why for centuries or hundreds of years the British and the French had so much influence in there\n","because they'd go in and they'd win something.\n","And then, and then they could call the shots for the, you know, period of time until the next strong man came up and, you know and caused problems.\n","it was important demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments.\n","because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay.\n","That's, that's the, uh, that's, that's the big thing, you know,\n","we still got a little bit of the old, you know, Vietnam, um, problem, you know, in the back of our minds.\n","we're, we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out.\n","Vietnam we never did get out, you know, never did get the job done because they were too ham strung .\n","they, they gave the guys, uh, the power and the material and the, told them to go do it and they did it. You know, got in and got out.\n","the, the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks I would think is, uh, you know, the, uh, the business with the, uh, the Shiites of all people, you know, in the southern part of the country and also the Kurds\n","because these people evidently are, you know, being killed off by the thousands.\n","And whether the, the United Nations,\n","I don't think the U. S. will do it on their own\n","but whether the United Nations comes around and says, hey, wait a minute we know this thing isn't, uh, all that much over, we've got to go back in there and, and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out.\n","Which is, seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment.\n","Well, I don't think there's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they,\n","there, there never will be.\n","I mean, uh, uh, the only way that you're going to have peace over there, if, if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them,\n","you know, until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but I don't think we want to make that decision either.\n","So that's, that's a little rough, you know,\n","we're not, we're not quite up to that sort of thing.\n","Oh, well, that's, that's fun.\n","Those are real popular,\n","those are fun to do,\n","Well, I guess maybe we've covered the topic, pretty good.\n","I really don't have any other.\n","well I guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest\n","And mine looks real good\n","It does,\n","They are, they're beautiful.\n","There's very few places that you, I'll bet that you could, uh,\n","I think maybe if you were somewhere like California, where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants and stuff.\n","you have to watch that too.\n","And it, it makes you more aware of what you're eating.\n","Because you, you have to be.\n","I mean, you, you\n","I think you, you, you balance the foods, uh, you know,\n","you're more aware of what nutrient, you know, value each thing has,  and minerals.\n","And you're just more aware of food for energy,  for energy sake.\n","you, you do have to figure it out. And, and, you know, to get proteins and things.\n","you have to consider calcium and iron and things like that you, you're not even getting through your milk products,\n","your egg products. If you don't eat any of those,\n","but actually you can get everything you need through vegetables.\n","I mean, there are there are, there are,\n","you actually you can get more calcium through leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products.\n","A lot of people don't know that.\n","Well, the thing is that milk products,\n","our bodies don't, uh, don't, uh,\n","that kind of milk, it doesn't,\n","we, we tend to, uh,\n","We don't synthesize the, the calcium the same way.\n","We, we throw more of it off our out, in other words.\n","We, we slough some of it,\n","we, we send, we send some of it out because it, our body doesn't accept some of it.\n","So we're not utilizing, we're,\n","when it, when it gets rid of some of that, um, that we can't use, it get rids, it gets rid of some of the calcium. Whereas when we eat, say broccoli, you utilize all of it.\n","your, your body accepts all of the broccoli.\n","So, it's like,  it's like, say, a person using vitamins, as opposed to, uh, vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food.\n","Your body just doesn't accept vitamins and the minerals in the, the vitamins in, uh, supplements that it does in regular food,\n","So you kind of have a combination.\n","But, you know, I suppose if you really believe in something it's, You, you adjust your life\n","because your mind.\n","inside yourself you just, it's not right.\n","Like a chain restaurant or something.\n","because a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop.\n","So, I suppose you'd say I,\n","well I, I don't know whether it's age or what it is.\n","Or, or like evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain\n","and maybe they're afraid that people are going to, complain or something.\n","And I think that's a shame.\n","And I think that that we just tend to eat, overeat.\n","You can eat as much as you want and you like the food, you know.\n","Uh, a lot of times the foods,\n","like, uh, Haas's carry a bread bar that is just out of this world\n","Maybe it's not too bad.\n","And that is kind of steep,\n","I think.\n","You can do that, but it is difficult if you, if you work or, you know,\n","uh, that is taking the middle of the afternoon.\n","I do not think they were very good during that time.\n","At least there were not as many good ones.\n","Uh, the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a, a tougher rating. Which suggests that, that, you know, it will be more enticing to the, to the public.\n","And a lot of times it is added for no real, uh, valid reason.\n","Uh, which does not make,\n","and I think SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT was a little bit like that.\n","Uh, but DANCES WITH WOLVES did not seem to have anything added.\n","It was just all legitimate kind of, uh, film.\n","And that is where reason why I suppose it won so many Oscars, uh,\n","because it really was good even though it is such a long movie.\n","And it was shocking at the end too.\n","Uh, but much more true to life\n","and I think that is, that is the point.\n","Usually if a movie is good, once is enough\n","And, uh, it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie. And children, young children could see, could have seen that movie, uh, at that hour.\n","it was a good movie.\n","I mean it was well done but, uh, that is one reason why it was scary.\n","I think one is enough.\n","Just more of the same.\n","just a touch.\n","Well, the whole movie is kind of far fetched.\n","But, I mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched.\n","They hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody.\n","Not, not too often\n","That has gotten to be a whole camp idea now though, you know.\n","If you hear that music, you know, everybody knows what you are talking about.\n","It's funny.\n","Well, it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs.\n","It was good.\n","It was very good.\n","and then, and then, uh, Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player.\n","But, uh, he certainly could have been. Uh, which was kind of interesting. You know, someone who, uh, who was a real activist but then took up the cause. Uh, kind of gave up, you know, because he did not think anything was happening,\n","but there are certain, uh, qualities that suggest it could be he.\n","and that, you know, that is what makes it so interesting.\n","It is an incredible book.\n","It, uh, really is very, very interesting.\n","So it could easily have been patterned after him.\n","I just thought the the, uh, author could have been patterned after that, uh,\n","I mean that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him, certainly.\n","Sort of interesting,\n","I think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just, are terrible.\n","and that's a, to me is a real drawback.\n","and those are really nice in good weather.\n","Everything else is, you know, a luxury,\n","and they, make the car more expensive, but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong.\n","It's, it's funny, um, uh, that you use,\n","sometimes, one advantage of an American made car, is if you get stuck anywhere, most local garages can fix you up.\n","But once you get, if you, once you get something fancy, you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really,\n","You know, we certainly have the technology,\n","but, it's amazing,\n","you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic\n","I don't think I have to give up as much as I'm giving up.\n","Um, it's a little bit like junk mail but except you can't, you know, ignore it, uh, quite as easily.\n","and it works very well\n","I guess that just comes with the, uh, with the territory with a family that\n","Well, I mean, that's none of their business.\n","So I mean there has been I think a lot to, done to protect privacy.\n","they're looking out for everyone.\n","you know, I think it's more safety than anything else.\n","I sometimes feel you know, sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit.\n","I mean I do want my pilot to be sober\n","I feel, you know, I think some of the people that oppose, you know, mandatory drug testing for certain areas say, well, it's not,\n","I kind of feel the same way\n","you get out of it what you put into it, I think.\n","It does have a lot of bearing on it, whether you are paying for yourself, or whether your parents are, you know.\n","that's not that wonderful either.\n","but if you, if you grow to expect that, you know, you kind of go there as sort of a vacation, you know,\n","that's really good.\n","I think they would do a lot better. Because they are more focused.\n","They know exactly what they want to do.\n","I say yes.\n","It's wonderful.\n","This is evidently this is one of the ways that they're paying for the program plus discouraging the people to quit smoking so they don't have to pay out as many, uh, benefits on like lung cancer and things like this.\n","so, you know, really when you look at it, they have full coverage,\n","they have H M O, which, you know, after you get used to it, it's not too bad,\n","and, uh, everything is covered\n","and we have so many people in the United States that we spend,\n","it is horrible.\n","Uh, if you're healthy it's fine,\n","and, and that's good.\n","But then again, I guess you can even do that in McCullum.\n","and that still goes on.\n","I know that it's getting to the point that the insurance doesn't pay that much on catastrophic illnesses.\n","Oh, that's a pretty big fish.\n","Now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view\n","And I guess that costs you an absolute fortune.\n","that's a good investment there.\n","and  it sure sounds like that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels.\n","Uh, they're, they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things.\n","Uh, I think one of the big things he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads.\n","And that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down here on earth including, uh, some new pharmaceutical techniques.\n","So, you know, there's  there's a big opportunity for us to explore, uh, what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment.\n","So. I suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that.\n","We can't live here,\n","we can't live there.\n","I mean, this is the, the place that we have to live.\n","I mean, there's, uh, no other resource for us to, to look at other than here.\n","I would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space\n","because we're always curious\n","and we always need to know more things.\n","But, uh, to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here.\n","Let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here.\n","the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us.\n","I mean this is it.\n","I mean if we would have, uh, if we would have went into space and found Mars a livable, uh, planet, we probably would have inhabited it\n","It would have been another planet to kind of take over and, uh, continue on.\n","It's it for us, you know what I mean? Uh, unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in space or whatever.\n","and the people, their moods are extreme, you know.\n","It's like, God if I don't get to see the sun I'm going to be in this bad mood all this entire time\n","I mean I don't thing they have any redeeming value.\n","and it's kind of cute,\n","and, you know, it, it's pretty cute.\n","those are pretty good\n","Well, and things are repeated, so often that you know if, if I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show if I ever decide to tune it in again,\n","Pretty funny.\n","That was pretty good\n","well Um. Well, I think it's caused a lot of, you know, big difference between when people had gone to war before, like compared to Vietnam\n","because, I mean, I know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over,\n","and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that, you know, and support the soldiers,\n","but then in Vietnam that was totally different, you know,\n","you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably.\n","And now, if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a, a good candidate. exactly, exactly.\n","it would be like a bonus for your, image or something.\n","I'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income, just drastically altered.\n","that's also a good reason why it, it,\n","or good that it ended as soon as it did.\n","I think the biggest change that we've seen, um, in, in my life or whatever lately is the economy,\n","and things are so tight,\n","and it seems like everything is raising, everything that can be, cigarettes, not that I smoke, but cigarettes, um, uh, stamps,\n","I mean it seems like\n","Even dog licenses\n","everything single thing that we do, is higher,\n","but that's not like, you know, as much as they should have raised it I'm sure.\n","so that was pretty interesting.\n","whereas before that never would have happened\n","Whereas it would have been,\n","people would have said, why are you going to work.\n","So, that's kind of a difference for us.\n","I think there's more pressure to, um, not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family.\n","The roles are changing a lot.\n","you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all,\n","And even, you know, I think a lot of the movies we see now kind of, kind of play a good part in our changes\n","And I think, you know that,\n","and so we probably want to do that even more now. You know since the women's movement in the, seventies,\n","and, you know, we've come a long way but I think it's still a, still have a good ways to go.\n","and I think there's a lot of, um, kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society, and race relations and things like that,\n","and, you know, I think there's so much prejudice still there,\n","and it's kind of more covert now.\n","People used to be more clear and say, you know, well, I believe in this or I believe in that,\n","and now, you know, I think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice,\n","but people think, oh, we're in the nineties, we're beyond all that, you know\n","I mean like I say, we've come a long way, but we have, I mean, twice as far to go, still,\n","and I don't think a lot of people, you know, realize a lot, the plight of a lot of people. You know, and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you,  but there's so many more people,  and that you don't even see or know about.\n","It's real easy to get isolated in your own little community,\n","and they,   they think the whole world, is like that.\n","because it really is exciting, to be around people of different cultures and different backgrounds.\n","so that's great.\n","I mean, people you know think they're kids have to have five, hundred dollars worth of toys.\n","the latest cereal about, you know,\n","that's ridiculous, too.\n","a lot of changes.\n","We haven't had too much,\n","but, uh, historically, we've always, uh, almost been like a big brother to, in, and to the Latin American area, and, uh, almost used them,\n","Uh, I think something will have to be done down there very soon about, uh, about Mexico and, and, uh, some of the other areas,\n","but, but, with the Persian Gulf, as you said, it's just, uh, been very quiet.\n","and you don't hardly see a,\n","and, and they made references to in the past, how we have given arms to, uh, Nicaragua and to other places in Latin America, and that those might turn around and haunt us someday.\n","I mean, not, not to this large scale as Iraq,\n","whenever we give arms to people, as we did, and as we sold arms to, pardon me, to Iraq, when we wanted them to fight Iran, and then, uh, and then it turn around and,\n","I, I agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world,\n","and so, uh, there's a lot of money to be made there,\n","and it's, uh, be very difficult to, to cut it back to a, a level where it should be.\n","And, and, uh, it will come back to haunt us,\n","it seems to come in cycles.\n","about, uh, like you say, using them,\n","our interest there is, you know, what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them,\n","and that we weren't normally very interested in them,\n","in other, in most Latin American countries, they, there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries, you know,\n","that they have corruption,\n","and, and they don't have, uh,\n","and the, probably the biggest problem down there is that's where the, that's the drug entry points,\n","especially Columbia, is so built on the, on on the drugs, that, uh, our, our little war on drugs has really been laughable.\n","It's just a, you know, such a small amount,\n","it, uh, cuts off just a trickle,\n","and, uh, if, if we can't get a handle on that through some, through some, uh, method, I don't know where,\n","that will be another big problem.\n","because that's just so much of the way that they make their money\n","and so many communities have, uh, have to have that for farming\n","And they don't look at it so much as, you know,\n","And as long as we're the largest, uh, consumer, then, uh, this is the market.\n","If we can cut back the usage, then uh, maybe it will have to go someplace else.\n","And I think it's really very sad that north of the border, you know, the United States and Canada is so different, from the from South America, and Central America.\n","There's really a disparity between the, uh, what a I would call civilization of the countries, you know.\n","and, uh, and, uh, there has to be resentment built up,\n","and that's where, uh, leaders can use, uh, use that whenever the opportune moment arises.\n","it's really kind of sad, and, that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and, uh, Israel and the Middle East Arab countries, and, and when we have, when we have a lot of problems, right in our own back door.\n","that's been, uh, that's been the way it's always been.\n","So I guess we've kind of neglected Latin America.\n","Very much so, except when we need them.\n","You know when they found oil in Mexico, then we got very friendly with them again.\n","Well, that's really sad.\n","and, sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating\n","and it gets kind of old,\n","and they play the same songs over and over,\n","now that there's just a million rap groups\n","and, and, uh, they try to, tend to try to do, outdo each other with raciness, I think,\n","But, you know, if you go two or three years without having that,\n","and also they get better quality\n","and they learn to have more features and things and without, and making them less expensive.\n","so C D won't be nearly as handy.\n","Now I guess, you know, one of these days when I get a new car, maybe, I guess all of them will probably have C D players by then,\n","oh, I'm sure it is.\n","I'm sure it is.\n","It's kind of sad that I've let that slip away.\n","Like I think Sears is probably the best place\n","That's, that's the aggravating thing.\n","You had to do it.\n","little things like that, that really start to aggravate you.\n","there needs to be a time of inspection and check out.\n","there ought to be someone there that inspects it before it's turned.\n","There ought to be an inspector or quality insurance guy after, after an oil change, you know.\n","Just in case, uh, they didn't put the oil in or whatever.\n","you're, you're always risking that.\n","If there's, too many people that get their hands on one little project, you know, that things, they're, you get, you miss that overlap sometimes,\n","and, and they miss things.\n","You need to really, uh,\n","So you can learn a lot that way.\n","number one, you've got to have the tools around.\n","If you don't have the, the special tools or,\n","You know, you can, you can look through a, a Chilton's book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it.\n","But you better figure on multiplying that time out, about by at least by five or so. just, just by not knowing, you know, how to get to that, that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart.\n","I think they're all bad, really.\n","Maybe you're right,\n","maybe you're right.\n","Because if you you know, pull on that,\n","Sometimes if you're a tinkerer, you luck out.\n","And so sometimes you have dumb luck.\n","you could have taken something like that and thought, well, the compressor's not working. Or it would have taken me all day probably if I didn't do that. But sometimes you have some dumb luck. If you have a little curiosity and you have enough knowledge to check things out.\n","And I know that's tough if you don't, uh, at least give it a shot.\n","That's surprising that they, that they have better requirements.\n","That's what I like to see.\n","they're going to have to be, well,\n","You know, it's just sad\n","I think that that, there's a lot of inconsistencies when some conference, uh, players come from outside of Texas, you know, and play us here.\n","and there's no consistency.\n","Seems to me, that like Purdue, when they're trying,\n","a student athlete is spending so many hours in class.\n","He only has twenty, twenty-five, whatever hours he has to spend on practice.\n","He should be playing, they all should be playing another team that, that has about twenty hours to practice a week.\n","But there are teams that practice sixty hours a\n","week, they're not going to class at all.\n","There's too many semi-pros in college\n","and I think they ought to get rid of that.\n","and I think that the football and basketball, they asked us to talk about basketball, should, you know, let, let them go, have a semi-pro team.\n","But I think, I'd like to see college athletes,\n","Uh, they're high scoring,\n","there's no defense it seems like,\n","and they just kind of score a hundred twenty five points, you know, hundred twenty-two, you know,\n","it is fun to watch some real disciplined teams play in, in college.\n","their style of play was so much different from from the teams that just run and gun.\n","but that's so much fun to watch because they're, they're pure amateurs, you know, and there's no money involved.\n","You go to college,\n","you don't really know,\n","it loses it somewhere.\n","Whatever sport it is, if they're really putting a lot of money in,\n","these players, let's face it, ninety percent are being paid.\n","I don't think that college football, or basketball, should have to be semi-pro, you know.\n","Texas is is usually not the best team, you know,\n","because the other teams are, I'm sure practice a lot more,\n","and S M U down here in footballs and trying to get back, uh, to having true student athletes,\n","There's just so much pressure on the schools, I think to win, though, you know.\n","And, you know, it's like if they don't win, they don't get any money, so, and the school suffers, which is kind of bad,\n","but that's just how it always is.\n","And, and they seem to be,\n","And I, I, I just think that amateur sports should stay in universities,\n","that's where it's at.\n","It just seems so sad to have to only rely on, you know, college football.\n","But I didn't think that was the objective, to make money.\n","But it seems like it is.\n","but again high school football is just so much fun to watch,\n","because, uh, you know, not everybody plays of course, but they're still,\n","it's good\n","and you know they're going to class, you know.\n","It, it's, it's real amateur sports.\n","so that's, I mean, that's pretty big.\n","The Pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd\n","You know, the high school games, I mean, that seems to be the big attraction, and college.\n","that's it,\n","of, uh, pro anyway.\n","seems like you could set the score at a hundred and then give them five minutes to play,\n","then it'd be the same result.\n","Because they, they start,\n","they shoot so much,\n","and then the last, what, five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner, I guess.\n","he never quite achieved the, you know, the super stardom that he had in, in college,\n","Oh, they help you.\n","Oh but that's nice, you know,\n","I mean the peach tree is, is a start\n","I can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards.\n","you really, really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer.\n","and um, that's really what makes the most sense,\n","because you don't have to use so much water,\n","it really does the job.\n","And if you're not really committed to it,\n","Well, I would assume, too,\n","I mean, you've got three or four months you're talking about of, of bad weather.\n","Well, it sounds like you, you've got your hands full\n","And, you know, gardening isn't, isn't high on the list,\n","but it's not off the list.\n","well, it's very therapeutic,\n","I think, really to get out there and dig in the dirt, you know.\n","Maybe next year they'll do better.\n","The cleaning up can be a mess.\n","It is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that.\n","Oh, it is probably in there just burping goldfish.\n","That is a good idea.\n","because health care is so ridiculously expensive.\n","That, that helps some,\n","it depends on what your deductible is how high it is.\n","And probably the medical care is less expensive, too.\n","should be.\n","It would be more convenient, more productive I think,\n","those three things, the health care, vacation, and day care are probably the most important benefits.\n","I think those benefits you mentioned, sometimes they're even more important than the wage itself.\n","If you can get those benefits even, uh,\n","they, they come out to much, a much better benefit than, than an increase in your wage a lot of times.\n","certainly something like day care at the work place would make life so much simpler that it's worth paying, you know, having a lower salary.\n","it would make it a lot better.\n","because your life would be so much easier.\n","And there's a question of quality of life also.\n","Uh, well, and if it was there, you would really have a little more, uh, knowledge on what's going on probably, you know, with your child.\n","and, you, you, you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened. And, you're less preoccupied with it, I think.\n","But unfortunately, there aren't,\n","But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones. Just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and things like that.\n","and that, that would be great,\n","many times at a large company it's almost impossible to do things like that.\n","They say you're going to do it this way, and that's the way it's going to be.\n","And if you get two weeks off, you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day.\n","So it all depends on what your position is there, too.\n","well, that's true in any, any company, I think.\n","those have its pluses and minuses, too.\n","Usually consultants make very good income.\n","A consultant really is, should be more knowledgeable than everybody else, you know\n","so it stands to reason they should really have more benefits.\n","and they'll do it,\n","That was excellent.\n","and that was, that was pretty funny,\n","I don't think it was as funny as what I was anticipating,\n","it was, it was more of a love story\n","it was a, uh, of course, one of the typical you know, kicking, fighting lots of blood and guts and all that type movie,\n","well, it's amazing,\n","but really, I mean, when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie\n","and yet it was his character that was so intriguing,\n","Oh, it was excellent,\n","and, and, of course, he's such a, uh, very good actor anyway\n","and, I think he made the movie,\n","you know, Jody Foster was good, too, but I think, I think Anthony Perkins was the one that, that really made the movie,\n","but I thought she,\n","That was, that was pretty interesting movie,\n","that was really intriguing,\n","and that one was.\n","and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats,\n","It's pretty, it's pretty cute.\n","that, that was just, you know, had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie,\n","but we seem to have a duality of, in this country where most states in theory have it, but, but, but do not use it.\n","I think there are certain crimes that definitely, uh, call for it.\n","I, I feel like that child molestation and murder\n","I don't see any sense in someone living that does things like that.\n","I, I don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way,\n","So instead all of our prisons are full of people on, you know a lot of people on death row.\n","Uh, Texas uses it as, about as much as any other state.\n","which is not very often.\n","uh, in fact, I think that, it, it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available,\n","the sentence of life without possibility of parole, uh, has become a common one, and is being, being used much more.\n","really in fact they're, they're releasing people, uh, that are in there for, you know, not major crimes, but, uh robberies and assault and things like that,\n","and, because they don't have room, which then they're coming back on the streets and of course, doing it again,\n","and um, you know, so we're having problems in, in that way,\n","and I know that there are some cases that, uh, you know, capital punishment does not fit the crime,\n","and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types, um, but I have to say that I'm honestly for it\n","uh, almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\n","Uh, we are, I guess, the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment.\n","they do not have it in Europe, as I understand.\n","Probably not in Eastern Europe these days either.\n","Um, there are many reasons for it,\n","but they, they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates.\n","you wonder what their, you know, how they manage to do that.\n","Well, in part it's, uh, it's the nature of societies, perhaps more homogenous society, in many cases, uh,\n","arguably is because of, of, uh, of, uh, welfare state benefits.\n","Though I tend to be, we tend to be skeptical.\n","oh there's no question that, that they, that, uh, you know, they have, you know, all kinds of cradle to grave, uh, programs, welfare programs providing for everyone some way.\n","But we have a lot of welfare programs\n","if both do and they tend to have less crime, you wonder if that has anything to do with it then,\n","in our society, people are brought up over here thinking that, you know, everybody owes them something.\n","Um, I think, I think that idea is even, even more common in Western Europe.\n","I would have said that it was more prevalent here in the United States.\n","That's an interesting theory.\n","and, uh, the TIME of course, is, uh, you know, more newsworthy\n","and, uh, it has more world affair type things, of course.\n","but you just don't hear people talk about them,\n","I don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be\n","even GOOD HOUSEKEEPING I don't,\n","and some of those have had what, what I consider or what\n","I get the idea that they are maybe the, the more pricier type magazines, as far as women's magazines.\n","They seem just to be so chocked full of, of ads.\n","and there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes, very expensive jewelry things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing\n","that's true.\n","unless you just want to skim through while you're,\n","that kind of is a good way to do it.\n","so. Well, it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines\n","And I find it one of the best.\n","Seems like it wasn't anything but bad news\n","I guess it's kind of the sadist in everyone\n","and, and they kind of capsize it and everything\n","and I think sometimes it's, you know maybe a little biased, you know\n","and sometimes. You don't, you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts.\n","and with interest, you know I found some people that were members of our church which was different.\n","And that made you even feel a little more kin to, to what was going on.\n","So that was interesting,\n","that's nice sometimes when they they pull it down a little bit like that.\n","Nobody should get that way about the news. And what's going on in the world.\n","It's the best.\n","They just kind of catch you.\n","and the difference in coverage was unbelievable.\n","That is if you, if you want to go to bed early\n","it's nice to, to, to watch that early news sometimes,\n","but the coverage wasn't near as good as when we, you know, switched over to channel eight\n","I, I think one of the, the biggest, uh, improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into, uh, management\n","and you're seeing them, uh, get, uh, elected to, uh, political offices. Uh, not near enough.\n","You're not seeing, you know,\n","looking at T I, you see them in management, but you're not seeing them up there as V P\n","I, I think you do see more and more women out there in politics, too, as mayors or, uh, you know, in, in helping to maybe, uh, get some legislation passed to, to have women have more rights.\n","I think still, even with that whole, um, thing with Judge Thomas and, and, uh, you, you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man\n","or something the way they had the trial\n","and uh, I just think that it's, it's still going to take another generation or so before, before the women really, could really feel that they're really equal in the business world and that they work just as hard or harder\n","going from, from homemakers into, uh, corporate leaders is still a big step.\n","I also think that, uh, uh, women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be.\n","Used to be people would say, do you work, and you'd say, no, I work in the home\n","it was, it was, then it was almost like a put down, particularly, particularly even by women in the work force.\n","But, I think now, I think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very, very important.\n","And it's getting the respect and, which is about time.\n","I think it's true.\n","I think also people are having children at a older age\n","you go through college\n","and then you maybe work for a few years\n","and then you have your first child\n","and, uh, you know, you, you know both sides of the coin.\n","You know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly, and to take care of the kids.\n","And, and then, uh, maybe people that are just working and think, oh, you just stay at home.\n","But then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid, it's like, they lose it\n","They say, wow!\n","And, and, to those that have never worked and had, you know, and have stayed home with the kids, kind of does your heart good\n","Which, again, I think it helps a woman's role.\n","Their role has to change to kind of accommodate us, too.\n","I know,\n","And, and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties, or early forties to have their first children, I think are absolutely crazy.\n","and that's not considered really young these days,\n","With, uh, the big one I thought was very commercialized.\n","It was.\n","But the other two were just lovely.\n","it was quiet and restful, and, and so beautiful.\n","It wasn't commercialized.\n","That was wonderful\n","That was That was nice,\n","It is just absolutely gorgeous with the mountains\n","is, is a little scary,\n","Now that's a pretty city.\n","Uh, it's really scary to listen to the news every night and to hear about all the problems.\n","but it  but it does seem there, that there is a lot more here in Plano of, uh, just bored teenagers\n","and, and that's pretty much what it is, is you know, kids that are bored, like you say.\n","But, uh, it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe\n","And, uh, there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to,\n","but it is scary.\n","now I don't think necessarily in this area here, but just Dallas in general.\n","and they're not really very safe\n","And so that's been something that's been good for the, you know, in this area that you feel like, uh, you know, there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today.\n","And I guess,\n","Pretty scary.\n","It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get into the system.\n","I know,\n","the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been there, are going to be killed. Um, there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent\n","I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed\n","That happens on occasion,\n","it sure does,\n","maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know, has affected you personally.\n","or a person personally.\n","I think I would be, you know,\n","I don't know that it's a big deterrent really.\n","I don't know that it is.\n","I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or not.\n","Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it\n","it goes on for years and years, and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, taxpayer money.\n","it's really sad.\n","I just think, um,\n","someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know.\n","Is really kind of bad\n","it is.\n","It's a tough, tough question.\n","It really is.\n","I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that.\n","Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.\n","and there really are criminals that are hard-core and, repeat, and never have any chance for,\n","It is with a lot of other people.\n","But like you say, if it hit you personally, closer at home you would feel, feel differently.\n","That's a, it's a tough, tough question,\n","it really is.\n","But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.\n","I think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have capital punishment still.\n","A lot of them had to have elected not to do so.\n","You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you know, something,\n","Well, and it doesn't seem like very many people, uh, are really, I mean,\n","there's a lot of people that are on death row. But there's not very many people that actually, um. do get killed.\n","a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.\n","So, it seems like a of people live there,\n","and then through appeals.\n","Because I know they do frequently,\n","the first appeal is automatic,\n","so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat.\n","There's, there's a lot of, you know, last minute, uh, things that happen cause a person not to, have to go through the whole thing.\n","which seems so awful.\n","So, it's a little bit more humane,\n","I guess, it is,\n","it would almost have to be, I suppose.\n","If you, if you had to chose, I guess I would, I am sure I would take the lethal injection.\n","the other one just seems so terrible.\n","It's a, it's a tough question.\n","It really is.\n","I don't think it's a monetary thing.\n","we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of deterrent or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like that.\n","Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, you know, useless.\n","This may seem to be the best way out.\n","I don't think it's a monetary thing.\n","It's, It's kind of been scary, to think about it\n","everybody does.\n","You hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the, in statistics,\n","it's nothing to be proud of,\n","certainly not.\n","it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way.\n","And how they would expect, how they would hope,\n","I mean you, you hear of people who have, um, committed crimes, and then they get out of jail and they go, and they do the same thing again.\n","And you wonder why they can't just stop it.\n","So, maybe you would,\n","just like constantly, it seemed like,\n","And it's not that,\n","I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the jury,\n","it's, it's a big responsibility,\n","it really is.\n","It is, it's a tough subject,\n","it really is.\n","I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, uh, guess it's important, that we decide as a people what, what we're going to do.\n","So that's real good.\n","Probably the more you pay, though, the better the machine you have.\n","well, in bad weather, you know, well you'd have to do something inside.\n","It's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle.\n","The most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner.\n","really have a lot of variety.\n","Well that could, That would have been interesting.\n","It's interesting, though.\n","I, I presume,\n","and they must have been asking.\n","they're pretty.\n","So I'm sure you'd find something.\n","They don't either,\n","That's a very common experience.\n","well, if you, if you can make yourself do the tread mill, I mean, gosh, that's a good workout.\n","you're lucky.\n","The test is a booger. The test, the exit test.\n","It is so hard.\n","right after you get out.\n","and they really don't help you a whole lot.\n","But still sort of up in that general  area of the country\n","so you can probably see them sometimes.\n","Well, it sounds like they're doing quite a bit.\n","But once they get established, then it's a money saving thing.\n","that wouldn't be so bad.\n","I think people are getting more interested\n","and they are more concerned.\n","And we're just, we're just real concerned about this incinerator because we really, they want to put it right in, uh, in between two of our main water sheds that feed the Clarion River.\n","We, we just don't think, we don't think some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests.\n","And, uh, it's, it's been a real struggle and a hardship for a lot of people in our area that we've, have, you know, have been fighting against this thing in trying to have things changed,  to make them more, more right,\n","Well, I think probably more people, you know, would participate if they just made it a little easier,\n","and like you say, make it, um, better for companies to do these things, and get involved in it without huge cost to them,\n","because obviously,  no one wants to spend a lot of money,  just to deal with trash, you know.\n","Uh, well,  We're, we're going to pay for that, that whether we pay industry or,  pay,\n","We don't, we don't need three quarters of,  what we get.\n","but they think, and probably they're right, people buy it easier .\n","that's their marketing.\n","And I know people would be willing to do more, like saving their newspapers and that, if they had a place to take them.\n","But I don't that it's a big money,\n","and, uh, it's hard to beat any of the benefits that, or salaries either,  that we get from T I.\n","Course there's a few things that, uh, I think I could do better if I was sitting up in the C E O's seat\n","but, uh I think Jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes.\n","that, well that one certainly is high,\n","I sure like that one.\n","That's like automobile insurance.\n","You never want to get in an accident\n","and there's nothing to compare with, uh, T I here.\n","they seem to be doing a good job of that.\n","It's very sophisticated.\n","And I guess it may be one of the best, uh, that anyone's doing.\n","you see, just like you were, you're saying, you've only got, uh, so many years, And then just add the money together like you do with a four O one account, you know.\n","and I'm saying that pensions, say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away, which it probably will,\n","I think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose.\n","Uh, well social security's going to go to way, I think\n","You have no control over your social security.\n","And it's not paid for by the current,\n","say we retire after the year two thousand, social security's paid for by the twenty-five year olds.\n","it's there.\n","You don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you, you know.\n","and instead of having a, a socialized pension, it just would be really money that you and your company,\n","maybe you had to put some money in it, too,\n","But I,  I can see where they'd need to do something on that because the statistics are,\n","you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own, you know.\n","You work for five, six, seven,\n","It would be nice if they could get them together.\n","I guess you,\n","you really do use it throughout the year, because you get your teeth fixed and all that,\n","Maybe you still can do that.\n","but it's a lot cheaper,\n","you know, it's a very common thing.\n","I'm sure we're getting close to our five minutes whatever, here.\n","I think that's a great one,\n","That means you're really sick if you have to use that one.\n","So that's, that's fair,\n","I mean, it's reasonable.\n","Four weeks is a lot, I think.\n","and I don't think I'll ever see a, a silver badge.\n","they'll give somebody twenty-five years and they'll serve what, eight months.\n","I have noticed that, that, that kind of stuff does seem to happen quite a bit, um,\n","But I think trial by jury is, it's a lot better than leaving it up to one person.\n","I think trial by jury is very good.\n","they said, I think the tape said something about changing, uh, changing it such that the,\n","or leaving sentencing up to the judge only.\n","I think that's actually good idea.\n","Um, because I think that that, that judges are probably more informed as to what is, how serious the nature of the crime is, and stuff like that\n","because, the general public doesn't know that if, if they're sentenced to life that they won't serve life.\n","Course the judge will know when he'll be up for parole and all that.\n","so he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence, in some cases there.\n","you can hear.\n","too many people can take vendettas out on people, and everything.\n","there are two people who say well he just looks guilty, um.\n","That's actually, that's a wonderful way to get off jury duty, you know.\n","They quickly let you off jury duty I hear, um.\n","because they, they know that you're biased.\n","that, that, that, that, that's, that's the way it works there, um.\n","I mean, that's sort of a strange case because I wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone's guilty and one person doesn't,\n","and they can't decide for hours, unless they convince that one person, you know.\n","Well then they consider it a hung jury, I I think\n","and then they, uh, have a retrial,\n","I think they either have a retrial eventually or, or they call it a mistrial or something.\n","Well you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty,\n","it's just if they can't prove he's guilty\n","You know, would you give in.\n","I, I guess if they were to say, well it doesn't have to be unanimous,\n","what's the cut off number, seven, five, you know, six, six,\n","it's too bad one of us don't have some knowledge on this,\n","through the whole movie, you think this person's,\n","there, there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that,\n","you know, something like, something like, well you can't be tried for the same trial because that would bias the, the, the, the jury or something,\n","and I'm sure that, you know, it's the lawyers, uh, after the, uh, defendant, defending, oh, the defendant's lawyer and the prosecuting attorney.\n","I'm sure the prosecuting attorney could make a real good case if he, you know, knew all the details of the defendant's, you know, case.\n","when someone is, is on trial for something, you can't bring up prior convictions.\n","like if they're on uh, trial for rape, you can't have any, you can't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff, or whatever.\n","if it's related to the crime, they should be able to.\n","I mean if this man is, is accused of raping someone, then I think that something like sex, you know, the fact that he sexually assaulted someone is a crucial bit of evidence, that adds to the fact,\n","But they're not allowed to do that.\n","I'm sure there are some deep seated reasons, you know, to,\n","and I'm sure that, that, that there are some reasons for good.\n","Well that one does seem, that one does seem out of it, though, because it's, it, you're allowed to show their character,\n","And if it shows that their character's, you know, changes, gets capable of lesser thoughts like that and stuff.\n","that led to that.\n","Tell you what we need to do is go into law and then we'll be able to,\n","you'll help out a little bit\n","Putting the right people in the office, that's a lot to do with it too.\n","A lot, uh, a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the, um, general public wants,\n","so they'll be revoted and all that.\n","but then again often times they don't, as well.\n","Often times they don't, uh,\n","they just go, you know,\n","you've got people like who are, who are, you know, lame, lame ducks\n","and they sort of don't care about anything and just want to go ahead an,\n","they, sit on the fence,\n","they won't say yes and they won't say no to just certain issues just because they don't know what the public wants, or the public's split on it.\n","because most of it is politics, even in the courts.\n","Well even in the courts well, well, they're all appointed.\n","I mean, that's even another issue, you know,\n","should, should, should judges be appointed, you know,\n","but, I'm sure they will.\n","actually this is a very sad case.\n","then they let them out\n","and then they're able to do it again.\n","But, uh, that's one of the reasons I think judges should be the ones to sentence people\n","because they do know, you know, if you sentence them to three life times, then they probably won't get out on parole.\n","And, and he should be just locked up for life.\n","But they just need to do something with him.\n","He needs to be annihilated.\n","and by the end, I realized that maybe it would have been better if they had, it wouldn't have been a jury of his peers, but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead, to sort look at it, you know.\n","I mean, I don't think it's feasible,\n","but, it would be an interesting thought if you're,\n","Well, it's supposed to be a jury of your peers,\n","they couldn't have a, a bunch of psychotics up there\n","but give them a bunch of psychotics but at least have a, have a, have a bunch of psychiatrists, you know, just to look at him and decide from then.\n","And, in, in our society right now that's really something that's, that's, um, not respected,\n","and it's not, it's not, um, it's not easy to do at all.\n","I mean, there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the, if the wife is going to actually be a mother.\n","That's interesting,\n","and I'm sure you've, you've labelled the cause, because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave.\n","I think that that they have to be related.\n","my complaint would, would be, um, that I think that, you know, the kids in the neighborhood run wild,\n","and they, they destroy property,\n","and there's just no respect for, for people or property,\n","and I guess, you know, when you stop to think of it, these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives.\n","Scary,\n","I'm sure until at least school age, and maybe longer.\n","What this does is, it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care to raise the child for her.\n","And I think that that's a real, a much, much more viable solution, really.\n","So. That's an interesting issue though.\n","Oh, there's been so many,\n","But I think you put your finger on it, when you said that they're not respected if they don't work, because it seems to me that a lot of people I know, women I know, are doing very menial jobs in a certain sense, certainly financially\n","and, and probably you're right.\n","I don't see how they could be, especially not if they have to pay for child care.\n","You're probably right.\n","If she sat down and looked at it she'd be like, God, what am I doing this for, you know.\n","And, so, I, I guess you're right.\n","our society demands women to work if they're going to be respected.\n","Really sad\n","religion has changed, too.\n","Um, uh, some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they're in it for, instead of just, um,\n","some places still it seems like it's a social club.\n","You know, it's just a place to go, to visit, uh, to wear your nice clothes, and, and to sit around and talk,\n","but, um, I think a lot of people are really, you know, searching now to find, find out who they are, and who God is, and what all that really means now.\n","so that might be a positive change in society.\n","oh, it's, it's, um, it's beginning, I think.\n","Uh, but among, you know, people I know, I don't see a great, you know,\n","there are those people who have, have had serious questions all along, and, you know, are sort of pursuing it\n","but, um, the churches here are growing, leaps and bounds,\n","and I thought it was more because of the, the very transient nature of the area and that people were going basically just as you said, as a social to meet people, and that,\n","but, um, it's hard to judge,\n","and there are a lot of things changing, I suppose,\n","Just, you know, the whole, the whole environment, I find um, sort of, you know,\n","Well, I guess that's always happened.\n","Maybe not as much as now\n","it's, maybe it's more unusual now, when, you know, somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer,\n","and in the past, maybe the same percentage got them,\n","but we didn't know it,\n","Well, I guess we've sort of run dry a little bit.\n","well it kind of is an idiot box.\n","Now SESAME STREET is a good program because, uh,\n","It can be very educational.\n","And the COSBY SHOW is, uh, is, uh, kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money.\n","I think that sometimes the things they show on there though, uh,\n","the problems that their kids get into, are, are good to, uh, show that they do have problems anyway.\n","But they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do.\n","I mean, like I said, real life is not that easy.\n","He has to do something positive to help them.\n","He always got to change history is what it is.\n","That it is so good.\n","this is terrible,\n","that is not terrible.\n","It is really not.\n","Well, I do not think it is, it is healthy all the time either.\n","And that is one of the worst, oh,\n","I mean it is just real violent.\n","and it is like they show bloody, you know, things,\n","And before, in a western or something, in the, in the olden days,\n","And, and it was not, uh,\n","Today it is, it is really graphic.\n","They try to make it too realistic.\n","Too much realism I think, sometimes.\n","Oh, that is a fun show.\n","It is, it is cute.\n","That is cute.\n","That is a real cute show.\n","That has good moral values too.\n","Well, uh, I think, uh,\n","Oh, well, it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway.\n","At least we have the same ideas.\n","They are too smart.\n","I think alls you have to do is push a couple buttons.\n","Well, I think that is a good show too.\n","Now STAR TREK is good movies, good shows.\n","it is funny.\n","I think that is the one that it, uh, comes on before.\n","It is real cute.\n","But it is real cute.\n","and some of them are like, uh, videos like music videos, that go along with the songs about church and Jesus.\n","Oh, that sounds fun.\n","I think that's a little bit more east, further east, and and maybe south, if I am remembering where that is.\n","I think it's a little bit further north, when I think about it.\n","Well, there, well supposedly,\n","they always say it sleeps more than it does.\n","That is a really pretty state park.\n","and it's real lovely.\n","so it's, it's really quite pretty.\n","Apparently, an earth quake caused it.\n","probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in Texas.\n","I think so.\n","when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty,\n","especially in East Texas, it's really nice.\n","Well, that's interesting because we have a\n","Well, that's to be expected at, their age.\n","Well, everybody always says no more\n","But I, I think animals are really important in the family.\n","people drop things like that off, up there,\n","So that often happens that way.\n","I think, she was always a little bit leery of her.\n","So you just never know how that works out\n","But they say it's real important for children to have pets because, uh, well, they can go and talk to them any time,\n","they want to and tell them anything they want to\n","and, nobody is going to, you know, reprimand them or, know their secrets\n","they're very, unjudgmental\n","And the nursing homes now, they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home.\n","But he goes out people,\n","and real nice dog, uh,\n","It's funny how, um, how pets can kind of, um, oh, take on a certain status in certain areas.\n","because most campuses don't allow pets, you know,\n","they just do not allow them.\n","I know.\n","That's, that's kind of great.\n","it really was.\n","and it kind of made it seem more homey too\n","I thought that was most unique.\n","And it just, you know, kind of goes along with what you were saying, about the dog having sort of free run of the, the nursing home.\n","we've ruined them\n","They say ruined them\n","I, I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat.\n","so that that was right.\n","I think that we're paying too much taxes. Um, that, including taxes in general or income tax,\n","It's most interesting because we're one of the few, if,\n","but we certainly make up for it in other ways here.\n","they've been really holding out in the legislature,\n","and it's starting to show, um, in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded,\n","and, and I don't know if Texas is ever going to be able to, to, um, totally avoid having an income tax or not.\n","I think eventually they're going to have to do it\n","I can deal with that because I know everyone else is paying in too, I guess you know.\n","but then there's other things that they nail you for it like health and beauty products you know,\n","yet, your absolutely right.\n","And that's when it really starts to add on,\n","and, um, so, um, that's, that is sort of a help,\n","it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of, of tax on uh, any sale, as far as I'm concerned, um,\n","It's real interesting, this last, um, tax season,\n","Well, you are, you are the same age as my daughter, because she just graduated from college this year too.\n","I guess, as far as people like, uh, our family, we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class people with, Americans with um, college age students, you know,\n","I guess as you say, you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are,\n","I think they should go back,\n","but I think they should still go back\n","and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class, I think the burden should be put more on the wealthy.\n","you know, they always have the argument, Well, you know, well who's to say we don't work harder to get that you know,\n","well I don't care how much they take off of you, you know\n","I kind of have my doubts\n","you're still going to be above, on top,\n","and the ones that get the most pay do the least work.\n","it seems like, um, they must feel like they're paid for all of the years of experience or, um, or something, or just the title, sometimes um,\n","and it, it doesn't seem fair,\n","but I think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling, and not a, not a whole lot of work\n","I do think it's a lot of luck,\n","but like what I was saying about the social security, that's real, you know,\n","but I'm never going to see that.\n","Social Security is going to be gone before I ever get any.\n","or what's left is not going to be worth anything you know, in terms of how,  you can actually use it.\n","I'm sorry,\n","I put in much more than that, you know.\n","it sort of calmed down.\n","I guess we complain about taxes,\n","but, I guess, you know,  you have to be sort of,\n","you have to appreciate, yeah, what, what you do get for them sometimes\n","you have decent roads at least\n","and, um, I guess it's, it's worse, you know,\n","and, so, you know, I guess it's all relative,\n","it's how you look at it too.\n","and, um I'm sure there's a lot of pollution.\n","but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution,\n","the only way that you could actually live in the, in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house\n","and so it was quite a dirty city.\n","Um, if you were well protected by trees, which catch a lot of the pollution then you're fine,\n","but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises, you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution\n","and it's just going for miles and miles and miles,\n","and it's landing somewhere with the wind,\n","That's kind of the way Dallas is.\n","We're so flat and open,\n","so we don't have that advantage,\n","and ours I think is primarily cars, where we don't carpool like we should an airport.\n","and there's just an awful brown haze all the time\n","and I can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport.\n","but, um, they were always talking about the air quality of today is this, you know, the ozone or whatever,\n","and it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted\n","and many people are too busy getting to work, not thinking about, Okay, I could have carpooled with a friend,\n","it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and, you know, the gas,\n","everybody has their preference to drive by themselves\n","or, if they do, they, they drive with one little buddy, uh,\n","at least it's with one person\n","but most of the time people are saying forget it.\n","But we're paying for it.\n","we are,\n","and I'm sure you think of your children,\n","and you kind of say to yourself, what kind of future will they have when they think back and say, well, my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference\n","and maybe people are trying,\n","but they have to change attitudes,\n","And it seems to me that it's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections than we had growing up you can really see it.\n","they they don't even have that much that they burn, because they consume everything down to the thread,\n","Well, you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day, I think.\n","Well, I imagine that where you live, uh, you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year.\n","So you all are waiting for that\n","I think, you know, you have to spend more money on your clothing, and that because you do have to have the appearance, a good appearance to do a good job where you work.\n","there's some nice pantsuits out\n","You know, I think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional.\n","Look more like a woman, huh\n","And it's the men that make the rules\n","Uh, well, then you, you, you know why they make them then that way.\n","But, yet, you need to keep up an appearance for your husband, too, though at home. Because that's, I, I believe,\n","I think that the main issue at home is being comfortable in your clothing\n","and I, I think sometimes we lose sight of that. Uh, by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress,\n","and I assumed it was T I wide, uh,\n","but I, I guess I need to put it on paper and turn it in\n","or  a lot of people aren't going to get up, walk out of their offices and go there.\n","I think more people would take advantage of it and use it, uh,\n","I think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to, to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step kind of type thing.\n","So you're saving a lot of time and effort.\n","uh, I guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them\n","you know if you  you wanted to recycle you newspapers it was impossible.\n","Uh, I think they can do the plastics, like the liter bottles things like that.\n","Well, that's good.\n","I think people are becoming more aware. You know of, of the waste\n","and you know, so, you know I feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it.\n","You know, maybe it's making an impact\n","So, you know, that's just where I probably need to be a little more responsible, citizen wise, you know, looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way.\n","there's a lot of air pollution.\n","Um, I think industries and companies provide a lot of it\n","and, with, uh, I guess with the oil burning over in Kuwait and stuff, that would have a lot of air pollution in it.\n","gets a whole new picture to what real air pollution can be,\n","but, uh, that stuff going on over there.\n","so, it's, it's amazing too, you know, with that, with the oil wells burning over there, that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of cars every day, just in, uh, just in a little different grade, I guess.\n","Everybody loves their car,\n","That seems to be our biggest problem down here.\n","any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air.\n","It's typically water type situation.\n","and I know there's a lot of air pollution going in there,\n","but the fine is nothing, you know,\n","it's, it's,  like, like two hours of output or something like that.\n","I don't think Dallas is considered, uh, a real bad place for air pollution,\n","but you know, that doesn't seem to stop them there\n","It, it's that there really isn't a whole lot.\n","It's one of those, uh, it's one of those things that if they do a little bit and, uh, and, you know, every little bit does help,\n","and, uh, it will clean itself up, eventually.\n","the whole idea is not to, not to push the limit too hard, I guess\n","let the, you know, let the natural, natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible.\n","I don't think it's something that people really think about, either.\n","You know, it's, I mean, it, it should probably be a big issue, you know, because it's, it's doing a lot of damage,\n","it's something, you know,\n","I don't think many people really think about it, because it's nothing they,\n","I don't think we really have too much control over it.\n","And it's one of those things,\n","it, it's so hard to measure what, what the damage is\n","it's kind of like, oh,\n","I guess it's kind of like, kind of like cigarette smoking, you know.\n","It, it could go on for years and years until they start to see some results and people can actually, actually say, Yeah, it's, it's, it's doing, doing some damage and something's got to be done.\n","Um, there's, you know, there's a lot of things like that.\n","you can, uh, you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks,\n","but until it breaks, you don't really know that there, you were doing anything to it.\n","I think we both agree it's, it's one of those deals that, uh,\n","I just think there's a lot of other problems right now\n","and, uh, we've done a lot to take care of it.\n","we have tried,\n","That's, that's the kind of things that, uh, you don't see in this country,\n","and that's, that's why I think that, you know, it's,\n","I don't know if you can ever do enough,\n","but, uh, I think it's all relative to the, to the time and place,\n","and I think right now it's, it's pretty much under control.\n","That makes a big difference\n","I guess it just couldn't handle, the stress, and the heat, the record heat,\n","That is, that is awful and it, it takes time\n","you have to water your lawn\n","and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy, You know,\n","it is just pretty bad,\n","but I guess, um, I guess the weather hasn't changed too much from here to Houston\n","and, it feels good\n","I think it's usually this time of year when we get some, just torrential down pours.\n","That would not be fun.\n","but that doesn't guarantee anything\n","like you said, always takes way longer than anyone, um, is able to guess, because I know my husband he, he painted, when he,\n","Oh, and that can make a difference, too.\n","and you don't know what you to want to, put up there,\n","And it looked awful on\n","I don't think he did the interiors very well\n","Well, it's, it's not that easy.\n","It's like, it's, uh,\n","I, I don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say, Well, I'll accept something, or you just really have to get on their back, I mean, about things and, and working with what they say are professional painters.\n","I tell you what, the fumes that the, the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do\n","I, think so\n","but I couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it, the whole ceiling, you know, just within a couple of hours.\n","It makes you wonder\n","Really, it does, uh, for all that.\n","Well a lot of women are as knowledge about football as I am.\n","It wasn't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys, I'll tell you.\n","he'd be good at it.\n","He's such a motivator, he,  primarily, you know, with the quarterbacks.\n","That would be his specialty.\n","I wished, I wished they could work something,\n","That would be really great.\n","That may not ever happen,\n","Uh, Houston has had some wonderful talent, you know, down through the years\n","and in the earlier years they really had some super teams.\n","And Warren Moon,  is, is proving himself quite well right now.\n","he's very good.\n","He's very good.\n","He's one of the few, uh, Black quarterbacks that there are.\n","Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia, I guess last year,\n","So, you're right,\n","there are very few Black quarterbacks, or at least that are starting anyway.\n","I hope they, they do better.\n","during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better.\n","But, uh, I think they still have a little, I think they're still such a, a young team I think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential,  that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing.\n","that was just such super team.\n","Or, if they even reach that potential again, you know, they may never reach that again.\n","it would be tough to do,\n","it really would.\n","I think Mike Webster was left\n","He may have been the last of the old guard,\n","I think he is,\n","I think he was.\n","they had such a super team.\n","There's quite a bit of activity now,\n","of course they had so many, you know, nice, uh, choices because their record was so lousy the last few years.\n","of course you never know.\n","The guys they pick, you know, may never play a game.\n","You never know,\n","it's, it's a gamble,\n","it really is.\n","He just went all out every single play.\n","Of course, there have been some other great ones too, Dick Butkis, and Bradshaw, you know,\n","there's been so many.\n","Oh, you know, that's really funny, um,\n","He is,\n","he is,\n","of course a quarterback has a big ego.\n","They really they have to have,\n","they can't survive.\n","They always think they can win, you know, which is the way it should be.\n","I mean they were good,\n","but, I, you know, you couldn't deny that.\n","They were super players,\n","they really were.\n","that's kind of funny too, as a matter of fact\n","Some of them a, a bit embarrassing.\n","well they make mistakes too, I guess.\n","it's funny that more people don't get hurt. You know, especially, I would say the receivers,  when they're in the air and they get tackled.\n","it's funny some of their necks don't get broken.\n","It's, it must just take a hundred percent concentration, I guess, because they know they're going to get hit,\n","it's just a matter of how hard, you know, or where.\n","An they have to be in ideal physical shape, basically.\n","They look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem.\n","Gosh, what a beating,\n","they really do take a beating,\n","they really do.\n","I think he was just probably a passing phenomena, I think\n","of course, Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach, is knowing his, or, you know, knowing of his temperament, I'm just surprised he ever, you know, kept the guy around,\n","I really am.\n","He's such a, he's about a half hot head anyway, such a temper.\n","Oh, you know, and to me he does, um, oh, he's just so big and fat,\n","he doesn't even look like he's in shape.\n","He's just so big, no one can move him.\n","There's just so much mass there, I guess they just can't,\n","probably the guy is, you know, probably physically strong.\n","obviously not very fast.\n","But I guess it's just, like you say, a mass that nobody can seem to get out of the way.\n","As far as him scoring touch downs, you know, I think that was kind of weird.\n","now he has a real weight problem too.\n","He fights it every single year,\n","but,  he has a terrible weight problem.\n","But I guess most every team has has someone like that,\n","there's, there are some really big guys playing in football.\n","Absolutely they get bigger and bigger, it seems every year.\n","I guess you have to to, you know, to stay in the game I guess.\n","well, you'd have to, uh, or I would have to say, you know, someone like Montana, I guess, who's done so well for so many years.\n","his age is about to catch up with him though.\n","He's no Spring chicken anymore.\n","but he's still performing.\n","And like you say Warren Moon's an excellent,\n","Warren Moon's an excellent.\n","But he's very exciting to watch.\n","I, I, I enjoy watching him also.\n","he may, uh-huh.\n","I believe that's right at one point in time.\n","but he's a very young fellow.\n","of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot, if he's got a good supporting cast, you know.\n","If not, he gets beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway,\n","Dallas did better last year,\n","hopefully they'll do better this year.\n","I, I just think, you know Marino will get better\n","and, uh, his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the Super Bowl,  you know,\n","Miami's had some down years, too.\n","But they all do, I guess,\n","and with age comes,  you know,\n","I'm sure arthritis sets in with them,  you know.\n","that, that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game.\n","and they're so young,\n","but, they're retired, you know,\n","So that's when you think about it, that's really not a very long time, of course.\n","but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that.\n","Holy smokes, I didn't that doesn't seem like very long.\n","That's, that's a pretty short career on average.\n","Of course they play their, you know, cards right and do some good investments, they'll, you know, they'll do all right.\n","But a lot of them don't, unfortunately.\n","they, they're always branded, you know, as a bunch of outlaws\n","and,  if their, if their, you know, arrest record won't let won't let them play anywhere else, they seem to go to, they seem to go to the Raiders.\n","But that just may be, you know, perceived,\n","you know perception,\n","Al Davis is, he's a kind of strange character, strange, strange looking guy.\n","Apparently he's kind of a wild guy,\n","They've had some excellent teams, though, obviously.\n","they have.\n","I'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play,\n","they keeping talk about, you know, going,\n","I've, I've always thought that any, uh, crime that, uh, that, uh, intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life would be the ones where I think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps, uh, doing it again, and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that, you know, there's a, a very steep penalty to, uh, be paid when that's done,\n","you know, on the premeditated murders I feel if you're, you know, I mean, if it's beyond a doubt that you did it, you know I would say go ahead and execute that person as well.\n","But, it's the cases, you know, like sometimes you, you know, you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely, you know,\n","they really didn't do it.\n","There's always that chance,\n","but, I would say that, you know, for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, you know,\n","Well, I think that should be likewise decided by the jury, you know, because, I don't know, I think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for, any reason,\n","I don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it.\n","but it's, you know, it's not very often.\n","I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that, that anyone anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it.\n","Florida and Louisiana, I think, and, uh, some of the,  other southern states.\n","Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate.\n","Get that unemployment way up\n","so then people, you know tend towards crime,\n","and then they they start stiffening the penalties.\n","But it's funny that, uh,\n","I mean, like, you know, like I said I think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania.\n","and you don't really hear about it real often, how many people,\n","Well, in Florida seems like, uh, two or three times a year.\n","I mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed,  you know, compared to that and to how many people are being sent, that doesn't seem like very many.\n","So, of course, the, the attorneys,\n","Everyone would appeal.\n","they go all the way up to the Supreme Court, you know.\n","They almost always get thrown right back out again,\n","but they have to have every single appeal made open to them.\n","Some of these guys are really, uh, you know, violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that, you know.\n","And then they get out.\n","everyone knows they're going get, not going to get out.\n","they get out in three years on probation,\n","and they do it again, you know.\n","It's like a slap on the fingers for them.\n","I think that it should be,\n","I mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone, a murder, then I think, you know, that they should likewise, you know, someone should take their life also.\n","Although, you know, stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole,\n","I mean, these guys are certainly not going to, uh, be,\n","I don't think the parole system is really helping that much\n","I think that's its only purpose is, is, you know, to reduce, uh, the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early. Off earlier.\n","But some of these guys just don't care,  you know.\n","I think some of them would rather be in jail\n","They probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets.\n","Um, that's possible I guess.\n","that all depends, too, on where you are at.\n","That's, uh, sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are. Because the more grass root country, uh, parts of the country tend to, to support capital punishment, where the places that are, you know, less in contact with crime you know, the, the more, more urban, I mean less,\n","and that would be pushing it.\n","You know, I think people can be persuaded one way or another.\n","Uh, anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance.\n","like, I don't want that person sharing the Earth with me, you know,\n","I mean, that is just terrible.\n","there's less criminals that are, you know, turning themselves in, or, you know, pleading or whatever, because they know that the judge, you know, if they find them guilty is, you know, has the, the opportunity to sentence them, you know, for, for the death sentence.\n","That's something, you know\n","but, uh, whether they plea bargain or not, if they're guilty of murder, they're guilty of murder, you know.\n","So I don't think that they deserve anything less\n","and so the guy might get off.\n","And, uh, although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are, are guys that are, you know going to get caught anyways\n","There's always a few of those people that are, you know, lost their head or whatever.\n","I suspect we should do what everyone says we should do,\n","we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes\n","but Lord knows you one shouldn't say that.\n","but, something that the government hasn't been looking at is the source of the problem.\n","The true source of the problem is, a, that we do spend too much,\n","but also, b, that we don't take in enough.\n","Uh, too few Americans are working.\n","If more Americans were working and meaningful good paying labor,  and paying taxes,  and the tax structure was fair between the lowest and the highest income Americans, then we would have more money there to play with.\n","I mean, well, we also, we'd be spending less because all the money that, that normally goes to support those people aren't working, it's back in the system.\n","That's a real neat idea.\n","but, in fact, in some cases that's what we ought to do.\n","Not Reaganomics, thank you.\n","But, that's not going to work, uh,\n","We also need to, uh, assure that there's some work in the private sector.\n","I think we would fill up new technologies.\n","But I think we should also do something rather radical.\n","Well, that would put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway.\n","that might have a, uh, a good effect on, on, on crime anyway.\n","I think it would take some of that money out of the hands of criminals.\n","I think it would put, reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another.\n","I think that, I think most importantly it would give the federal government something new that they could tax.\n","And probably a lot of.\n","And probably a lot of\n","and really receive some revenues from.\n","Uh, if you look at prohibition historically, it's repeal helped the federal government a lot in tax revenues.\n","Then I think once we put money back into the in the coffers of the federal government,  and get the federal government to where there's money there again, we should reduce the amount of money,\n","and this would have to come rather quickly, and would have to come originally also where we're not paying,\n","in some cases we do pay more, for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage environment.\n","And you can't deny people the right to supply their families better through whatever means.\n","That's just sensible on their part.\n","It's just sensible on their parts,  to go after the, the, the greater amount of income.\n","So, if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs, not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage, then more people will get off welfare.\n","You know, give them a true incentive to want to work.\n","And then don't start letting more outsiders in for a few years until we figure out exactly where we're at with unemployment.\n","Reduce immigration,  or eliminate it entirely for a few years, until we get our own house in order.\n","and maybe even reduce, along the same lines, maybe reduce imports as well, I think.\n","when we're in a world of hurt, well, I don't, I'm not going to say that we ought to reduce them through legal means.\n","I think we ought to just tax them severely.\n","And other places they tax us quite\n","I mean, they tax American imports quite heavily.\n","So, we could do the same thing,\n","It seems only fair.\n","And I think really if we got all those that are able-bodied into the work force reduced the amount going out for those purposes, created new jobs for that work force, there would be plenty of money.\n","And then at that point,  quit spending on space.\n","Force it all into the, into the private sector.\n","Well, at that point you might, we, it wouldn't be a problem anymore possibly, you know,\n","we would be,  we would be able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do,\n","that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work.\n","Well, that's a good idea.\n","well, the other thing, and the other thing I, I, I think we seriously need to do is, um, like I say, have someone go in and look and, you know, and find out where it is we're paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something.\n","the government specifications,\n","sheets of paper for building a pair of B V D underwear for the federal government,  is twenty-two foot tall.\n","To just understand those legal requirements and operate within the government guidelines,  costs the company a huge amount of money.\n","Well, that's potentially a fault of the government then, I mean, that could, things like that should,\n","a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor.\n","Uh, a huge amount of what you hear on, about the seventy-five dollar hammers,  and the nine hundred dollar toilet seats doesn't come from people in the industry,\n","it comes from senators that don't know anything about it.\n","Uh, my job is government tooling specialist.\n","Course that's like that, that, uh, hooking that you were talking about.\n","That takes a lot of time.\n","That's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff.\n","But, it's it's nice to have it when you're done,\n","I mean, looks pretty.\n","they, make conclusions in them that may or may not be true.\n","But they are very interesting. that, they have, what they have discovered.\n","And it answers everything.\n","well, not everything\n","Those are, oh, interesting.\n","That book, uh, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC is really a fascinating book, uh, uh, if you ever get those\n","the photographers just got fantastic pictures in those things. Uh,\n","And it is just weird.\n","Well, we can talk about anything we want.\n","Well, for me there is no\n","hopefully, uh, we will recover here, uh,\n","But that is Bush saying that\n","I do not really know if, uh, any one person knows, uh, uh, what some of the problems are.\n","Uh, but there, there are some, there are some interesting things in the paper, really.\n","you sound like you have a family too.\n","But with a family and everything, there is just so much going on that I, uh, actually I am more of a\n","I know you do, being an engineer.\n","There are some times when you have got ten or fifteen or even an hour off\n","It is, it is, it is, uh, interesting, uh, with the computer to read the computer news and, all that.\n","I, I guess that is a, that is a source of reading.\n","I hadn't thought about that in that respect, uh,\n","It, it does have a good, uh, simple, uh, you know,\n","again you can read it in, uh, in a lot less than ten minutes.\n","you can, you can page through it in,\n","some of the stuff is pretty boring.\n","Well, I guess because he was so rich, you know.\n","When you are that rich, uh, you always get into the paper, whatever, if you have a family problem, whatever.\n","Uh, Donald Trump and had it all.\n","That has got to be hard to go from really rich\n","But, uh, he was kind of an arrogant guy,\n","so I think the newsmen, uh, enjoyed, uh, writing about him on his way down, you know.\n","and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that\n","If you've got the cash to pay for something, it's better to do it that way than versus credit cards, unless it's a small enough sum that you can do it within a two, three month period,\n","but if it's, uh, any large purchases, uh, you've got to kind of think about, uh, how much you're going to put down as far as, uh, payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off,\n","Or, if it's a business transaction a lot of times that's important, too to keep a better receipt of it.\n","Be interesting,\n","that's nice, because you can use it for a calling card also.\n","It's kind of fun, uh,\n","That's, that's to entice you to get more credit cards.\n","I, I can't see paying an annual fee for it.\n","Oh, you're already paying them, uh, if you're, if you don't pay it off within that month, interest, anyway,\n","that's exactly it\n","I, I guess both of us are very much aware of the equality.\n","Uh, it seems like women are, uh, just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in, uh, jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did.\n","Uh, it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes, making supper, or taking care of the kids\n","well, if you did that you were henpecked or whatever.\n","But, men are starting,\n","There are still some that aren't cooperating\n","those are very few.\n","I think those men don't last very long in relationships because I think women know what they want.\n","They're not accepting that anymore.\n","And it's, it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything, uh, you know, and then kind of real light pay.\n","There's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all.\n","So it's, it's kind of a, uh, neat thing to see as far as equality in the households,\n","and I think that's even going to get better. Even, you know, even more so.\n","I think it's just going to be where men will do as much cleaning as women do and that it won't be your job description instead of your role definition is this.\n","Well, I feel like, um, to an extent that is really important, you know, that, that, um, it is important for women who need to work uh, or are in a position that they want to that they can do that.\n","Um, but I also think it is important for them to be with the children.\n","I, I think there, there are some things that women just are designed to do better than men.\n","And there are some things that men are designed to do better than women.\n","I don't think it should ever be totally equal.\n","we're not made like that.\n","Well, emotionally I think, uh, women do a little bit, uh,\n","I, I think that's, the gap is coming closer as, um, what I've learned in, uh, just, just being out there.\n","It seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men's gatherings,\n","and they get together\n","and they talk about issues of marriage, talk about manhood, talk about what they didn't have with their fathers.\n","Are expressing more emotions, learning what emotions are.\n","It may be in the future that men, you know, some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves.\n","Um I, I know of some mothers that I, I guess I'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding, more, um, low key, more apt to be a better father than some mothers that I have seen that have been raised, you know, to develop whatever skills that they have,\n","and some of the men are developing, uh, very good too.\n","So, it may come down to where it's, it's individual basis. Where everybody is treated an as individual, and not by sex.\n","And it, it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that.\n","One of the frustrations that I have with the way things have developed is that, and for some it's not a problem, but there's more and more, it's difficult for a family to make a living on one income.\n","It can be done,\n","but you make sacrifices.\n","So, my home is typical.\n","those are lovely.\n","That's a pretty good size room.\n","That's important too.\n","And that's very important\n","It should bring up your property values a little bit.\n","Your pricing.\n","I think once the economic situation in the Dallas area improves, I think the housing will go up.\n","You know. Right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs, and everything\n","so that's, you know, that keeps prices down and value down\n","and I'm sure the packs , uh, or\n","would like for it to go up.\n","For that reason it can stay the same,\n","And you never know.\n","I mean, I think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours, it's fine.\n","Now some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while\n","but home home day care works well if it's an infant.\n","If it's, if it's,\n","And even in that situation, uh, the, it seems like to me from what I've read in, in the history of Russia and, and you know different authors, uh, there has always been a paranoia\n","They've always suspected everybody\n","and and that's why they put, you know, that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years,\n","and that's why they put a lot of people to death.\n","but Stalin was a, was a classical example I guess of that paranoia because he he probably killed more Russians than, uh, you know, the Russian army killed anybody else.\n","I guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot go into a war.\n","Uh, they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together,\n","but I could not foresee them severing what they have with the U S. Um, because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation.\n","Um, from what I've been hearing is the U S, uh, S R has been, uh, almost bankrupt for years\n","and it's people are desperate,\n","and there might be a revolution within the people.\n","But I don't think the U S would get involved with it because, uh, there's too close of ties to where I think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change, and that we cannot run them like we run the U S and that they have to make their own independent decision.\n","I, I, I have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would totally you know, it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time.\n","and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people.\n","But if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of, you know, doing whatever, uh, for their country, they'll do it. Uh,\n","There's a little more craziness down there\n","Uh, the Russian people I think are not that much different from us.\n","I think it's time that we start looking at, uh, getting into that.\n","and I think, uh, there's people that to me it's the fundamental, uh, life of a person.\n","Uh, it doesn't matter if you have money or no or all the money in the world, um,\n","Everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits.\n","Um, I think if, uh, they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and, uh, individuals, um, helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how.\n","But, uh, the expenses right now for health care, um, are just unreal.\n","Well, they really are even for, even when you're not talking about surgery.\n","or plastic surgery\n","and there's, you know, financial gains toward that.\n","And in a universal system I don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors.\n","The quality I think goes down. Uh-huh when you have a universal system.\n","Um, the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check, um, and also offering some kind of,\n","because I think, uh, all physicians, well, anybody, um, likes the ability to kind of, uh, get themselves financially, uh, situated.\n","Uh, I guess that's the whole U S concept is to come here and,\n","More motivation\n","and I don't know if you can have that with a universal system.\n","Maybe, you know, there's a way of working that out,\n","and that's sad because if that's the case, if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway.\n","But that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind.\n","But I, I think we have to head toward that way.\n","Well, we're going to have to do something because there's just too many people in the country that are uninsured\n","and, and you know you cannot,\n","I mean you're uninsurable. Unless you want to pay five hundred, six hundred dollars a month\n","I think, uh, people are changing their viewpoints of, you know,\n","it's getting harder and harder to survive.\n","And, uh and that's why, uh, if they don't go to a universal system, something is going to happen.\n","We're going to have, uh, a larger amount of people dying.\n","Well, it would be a lot fun.\n","You know, there is good and there is bad\n","and I guess all of Italy is not like that.\n","And you always have a fun experience\n","so it is great. You know.\n","Look professional\n","Unfortunately.\n","I think in today's society, uh, there is more credibility to be quite honest\n","you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie, you just, uh, he would be missing something.\n","Although, he shouldn't be evaluated on that.\n","well at least in some in some beliefs, uh, how people dress when they go to church is, uh, is uh, sometimes a pretty, pretty hot topic.\n","it is.\n","I guess that has changed also.\n","But you shouldn't, what's the old saying, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.\n","And, uh, evaluation of an individual. Course, all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have.\n","I think you have to dress sort of accordingly.\n","But, uh, you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and, uh, or evaluate a person by that.\n","This doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one.\n","Well, that certainly would be a wonderful, comfortable machine to take on long trips\n","My personal perception of government and, uh, the way things are at this current time, is that nobody can really be trusted.\n","And I don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to, uh, be self-serving to the community.\n","I think that they have their own, uh, wishes to, uh, be in the limelight and to kind of say, hey, you know, I'm a public official, I don't have to do, uh, certain things\n","and they just stand out more. Involving themselves more and more with politics\n","after all the things that I've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts, uh, of checks, uh, before that it was the wonderful, uh, escapade that they had with, uh, the new, uh, oh God , chief of, uh,\n","well Supreme Court,\n","I'm trying to think of his name and, uh, what they put, uh, him through in regards to,\n","The sex, sexual harassment, that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that.\n","I, I just think it's very corrupt and in whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor, and send them into government versus people that are rich.\n","But it's always the rich person that gets into government. That has the money to advertise, the money to to do this.\n","There's no more Abe, Abraham Lincolns out there, uh, that can get into government, even if they were poor.\n","right now every little state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health, uh, system\n","and, of course, they think, uh, Wisconsin, our or Minnesota, our neighbor, passed a state law, the health bill\n","and it's kind of like we're the first to do it.\n","So, I don't know if it's done because we're, we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for, uh, you know, a real good purpose to help people that can't afford, uh, health insurance, that kind of thing.\n","Well, I, I think the, one of the biggest problems that, uh, we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself.\n","And that is, uh, uh, we become so debt ridden and credit oriented instead of, uh, cash and carry or debt free\n","and therefore, uh, that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities, state and federal governments.\n","And  I think it, it is reflecting.\n","Like you said I think society as a whole, uh, you can't expect, uh,\n","when we have T V and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for, uh, you know, immorality and this and this and this, that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be clean, totally clean And come into government.\n","Uh, but down the line it does hurt.\n","I mean when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something, it's, uh, you know, it does hurt each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or, you know, the other things that have occurred,\n","see the thing is, is when a lot of things become acceptable practice uh, it's hard to discern the what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical.\n","And then  someone blows the whistle and says, oh, this is not ethical and yes I did it too.\n","Well, that's exactly what happens in government all the time.\n","They blow the whistle on each other.\n","and it's not going to get out.\n","there's no  secrets in the government. Uh  I don't think anymore.\n","that, that's another arguable issue\n","assuming you can buy into global warming I\n","I, I think that the changing, you know, from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage, you know, not using ...\n","it is so scary that I hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster, you know.\n","and, and I suppose that's, that's the ultimate, uh, pollution problem.\n","I, I think it's drawn in, uh,\n","I think, gets in there\n","it went quite a long ways but I, I, I guess I can be a little sympathetic\n","there, there's probably a lot of natural things, uh,\n","but when you when you get up in the morning in, in Dallas and, and see all that haze from west Texas, is that, is that pollution?\n","I guess it's got to be really,\n","that's the thing is that I think, I think Dallas really does have a problem in this,\n","the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel, burning fuel,\n","the problem is, is it's like Los Angeles.\n","People don't, people don't want to use mass transit,\n","well, I guess they do think something of it\n","you consider how much, um,\n","I think that, uh, all of us could use one electric car right now, I mean, today, because I think, uh, you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever,\n","you're right.\n","I, I think, uh, there could be a lot of\n","people close this is really,\n","Well, the problem is that gas at a dollar a gallon, you know, who wants to,\n","I mean, we want to not pollute,\n","but, uh, at a dollar a gallon, uh, it's hard to beat, the amount of energy you get from, uh,\n","on air pollution I, I, I don't know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really.\n","you'd think you would be.\n","That's why.\n","I think they're maybe going to give us a state income tax.\n","doesn't seem like it work to take it away when we're using it.\n","I know we're not using it so wisely.\n","We have too many administrators in some of these big districts.\n","Probably a lot more civilized, more, um, refined than a lot of the people would be down here.\n","this is going to be fun.\n","and they're the ones wasting all the money.\n","Uh, I think it's a stinking shame that there isn't capital punishment for those assholes that stold our money.\n","I, uh, I don't think it's over.\n","I think that, uh, so many other things have taken over, uh, in the media.\n","But, I think it was just plain greed,\n","and I think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks.\n","Go ahead loan your money out, you know.\n","I think it had something to do with deregulation,\n","but I believe, uh, more of it was just greed.\n","there, there should be thousands of people in jail as far as I'm concerned.\n","Not just a couple.\n","It may have started with HUD too.\n","I noticed that HUD was in terrible shape\n","and, uh, they lost a lot of money there,\n","and then some of these big, these rich people started to,\n","but, uh, they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit\n","and they just never even got conservative with our money at all.\n","everyone forgets whose money it was.\n","And, everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny American word.\n","as far as being a Republican or a Democrat, I think no American could stand for criminal action.\n","you spend your way to prosperity\n","and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls, I thought, well, that was the philosophy, you know.\n","Just keep spending until taxes are lower,\n","and, I thought, that's not going to work, you know,\n","and I knew that it wasn't going to work originally.\n","And, it hasn't worked now.\n","I, I, I agree with that,\n","but there's got to be some control\n","and apparently there was, you know,\n","Well, the problem is,\n","and the problem with Reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich.\n","And, for what they would cost\n","and we weren't producing anything.\n","We, as Americans weren't producing anything.\n","It was all inflation.\n","we agree too closely,\n","but,  But, you, you can't say that that was right.\n","I know, uh,\n","No intelligent person can say that we could spend our way rich.\n","Remember all we're doing is delivering pizzas to each other.\n","And, and not high quality ones at that, you know.\n","and I think that the,\n","a lot of the workers don't understand that, uh, they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them, you know.\n","It is a life and death struggle, with with the Japanese.\n","I, I'm very tired of it all pays by the hour.\n","You don't sound like a nonexempt, Jim.\n","You don't sound like a nonexempt.\n","Uh, you're too informed.\n","They're, they're very, they're very, uh, not interested.\n","They wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're talking about now.\n","That's not good\n","I mean, that's good that you're degreed,\n","uh, uh, your time will come.\n","Times are bad.\n","Well, now, is, is, uh, really terrible.\n","I think that, not, not only T I, but a lot of it, when they talk about, uh,\n","but there's something like about eighty six billion that they admit.\n","I figure well, if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty-six billion, it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes\n","and so if that's true, it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was, that went down the tube somewhere.\n","It's amazing really.\n","It's amazing that,\n","Course your value of homes up there are pretty good.\n","I almost think there's some politics around here, because the metroplex here, in the Dallas, Fort Worth area, the, uh, with T I,\n","Uh, uh, here lately it seems,\n","well up until a few years ago, I guess, there just too many liberals about and permitting too many, oh,\n","they just broaden the human rights to, to cover just about everybody, and I don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole.\n","It's just not right.\n","I think I agree with that very much.\n","And therefore I think juries should be able to recommend sentencing.\n","So many of us have led sheltered lives that, uh, when we go into a, sit in on, a jury,\n","Well now, that's possible.\n","Uh, well, there again, uh, I suppose it should be.\n","But then again, so many times you get one or two holdouts,\n","and, and it permits the criminal to get a retrial.\n","that's not too bad in this sense, because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances\n","I mean, that's happened and giving them another trial might give them additional time to, uh, prove their innocence.\n","We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials.\n","Un, apparently there are.\n","since my husband worked as a policeman, I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have, are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of.\n","Uh, but, I would suppose there are circumstances, you're in the wrong place at the right time, or know the wrong person at the right time.\n","and you just might resemble somebody.\n","Now that just was not fair.\n","I guess that's where a lot of the problem lies,\n","we're, we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people, the one's that are on trial.\n","And, And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to, because I bet, they still say our system is the best in the world.\n","Unfortunately, that's what happens.\n","Well, it's not, the, uh, uh, it's not the best system,\n","but it's the best one in the world.\n","it's the best one that exists, I guess.\n","And unfortunately, we just have to put up with a lot of things,\n","and they try to solve them and everything,\n","Oh, I think a lot of people are.\n","I think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country.\n","the, the, the First Amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action.\n","but I don't know if I'd go that far.\n","well, I think pride in our country and our flag is so important.\n","It's important in so many facets of our lives.\n","And, uh, I, I feel like if they don't, people don't like what our flag stands for, they're welcome to go some place else.\n","There's nobody holding them here.\n","See how they'd like it under another flag.\n","They'd soon be back,\n","I'm sure.\n","Well, Jean, we seem to be of the same opinions here.\n","I don't know about the judge making the decision, if that's,\n","but I think the jury should be able to recommend,\n","Of course, now, the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence.\n","Well, I think that's where a lot of people think, boy they're getting put away for a long time,\n","but actually, their chance, course, when,\n","a lot of times when they come up for parole, they're denied.\n","It depends on you know, what they're, what they'd been guilty of, and a lot of different things, I guess.\n","but too many times they, they are permitted to go out on parole\n","A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do.\n","And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again.\n","They just go out and repeat their crimes.\n","but I think they ought to make it two offenses.\n","I always thought there was, there was wrong,\n","it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody.\n","It seemed like there, sometimes there's not a good,\n","the balance isn't right.\n","It doesn't make sense.\n","Well, here again now, there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently.\n","Race or nationality even.\n","But, uh, like you said, it's, it's not the best system,\n","but it's the best one we've got.\n","Improve it if we can, if we ever get a chance.\n","And, uh, if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and, uh, you don't have to do all that much work. You know, you just, uh, slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce and away you go.\n","But dinner parties are a lot of work, uh,\n","you have to do a lot of work beforehand, I agree, and buy special stuff.\n","But, uh, so far as getting out there and, and putting it on, it only takes a a few minutes, uh.\n","Well, I, I think you do, do a lot of work.\n","Even if people do bring over things, you still do, uh, all the, uh,  housework and get everything prepared and utensils and just, just everything.\n","we probably ought to try this.\n","But it probably will never taste as good as we remembered.\n","I guess it gets better and better as we remember it,  back, as we get older, you know.\n","But we probably should try it, uh, to do that.\n","The recipes are really interesting, you know.\n","We're probably going to lose them\n","and we'll probably forget all about them, you know.\n","Since we're trying to make everything so\n","Now the hams just kind of, you know, go take it out of a can or, uh, uh, a package, sliced, uh,\n","It is absolutely delicious.\n","It was really great.\n","You know, that sounds like it.\n","I, I don't think so anymore, not with more, becoming more conscious of, uh, fat and cholesterol and, and all those good things.\n","That's an interesting point.\n","Parents, that's unusual.\n","It's just, it really is.\n","You, you don't miss it, uh.\n","And you don't really miss it.\n","and they keep letting out people that have, you know, these horrible records.\n","So maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something.\n","That's one thing I guess I could think of\n","Uh, it's definitely a big concern,\n","So it's pretty scary.\n","Unless they start enforcing the, uh,\n","It's rough, because\n","like: t, t, t, t, uh, start giving more people death sentences.\n","That's the only thing I can think of.\n","well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous.\n","I mean you hear about people, you know, six and seven times have committed burglaries\n","and they're still, you know, only serving six months in prison.\n","So that's definitely something.\n","They could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like, you know, from one month to ten years or something\n","That would be one thing that, you know, I think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties, you know, for certain crimes\n","Well, not only that, a lot of them's not even turned in.\n","Uh, but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not.\n","I believe it.\n","So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it.\n","But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, you know, for people to report it.\n","So that's probably something else they could do.\n","it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs, you know.\n","because these kids are saying why should I go to high school\n","So that's certainly a big problem.\n","I don't know what the solution to that is.\n","Having more drug treatment centers available.\n","Uh. See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything.\n","but I, I, I would say that's a bigger problem.\n","even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, you know,\n","huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, you know, on higher and higher up, on drugs,\n","and it's definitely got to do with crime.\n","You know, you hear about people selling their babies, you know, to get some crack.\n","gosh, horrible stuff like that.\n","So that's, you know, another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal, you know, for doing that to her child.\n","I mean the kids are the victim, it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted.\n","And, it's a very complicated problem.\n","I can't say that I, I just know that it's really bad in some areas\n","and something's going to have to be done sooner\n","It's frustrating.\n","so it should be real interesting.\n","and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very, very wide, uh, it's been a big change.\n","and I think you'll have to agree\n","and I think, you know, it got off to a really radical,\n","I think all things get started sometimes in that manner.\n","You know, they come in that way.\n","And, to make a change, you know, you have to make a splash.\n","but I really do think that women have made a contribution uh, to human beings, I mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions\n","and it's okay\n","and I think, uh, you know on the other hand, I don't know that men have changed that much.\n","So in, in contrast to the women's changes, uh, you know, the men stay steady,\n","and then the women change around them.\n","Uh, I think men are trying.\n","Some of them.\n","But they don't have a national organization of men,  to, uh, help them out\n","and uh, what's changing them, though, is the economic situation,  where both team, it has to be a team partnership now,\n","and they both have to work\n","and they both have to raise the children,  if we're going to have any kind of future at all,\n","and, and that, I think has been the downfall of the last ten years.\n","the, the yuppiedom,  the whatever it was, the, you know, women didn't know how to go about doing the careers\n","and they wanted to compete with men,\n","they wanted to be like men,\n","and that's wrong.\n","I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men, men\n","they, they hurt themselves a little bit in that way.\n","they sort of threw the thing back another, you know, ten years,  that they've had to, you know, restructure,\n","But, uh, I think men and women both have valuable, valuable assets to offer\n","we were biologically, physiologically, made differently\n","and there is great wonderment,  in that,\n","and, uh, you know, we should respect that in each other\n","it shouldn't be destroyed.\n","And, and, you know, just sort of all swooshed into one channel sort of thing,\n","it's, it's viva la difference  someone said that\n","and I think that you can truly respect the other person,\n","I mean, you know, Tom is just always saying, what a mystery you are, you know you know.\n","Well, that's kind of makes it exciting. You know.\n","I guess we've gotten more of a,\n","in, in terms of that, I think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles,\n","I think now when both are working they have a more more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way.\n","well, that's, that's a very different way to do,\n","you know, the woman doesn't start off at home,  raising the kids and goes back into her career, you know,\n","Because you get set in your ways\n","and it's,  really hard because to, to really to get help. Uh, you know to get the work load shared.\n","That's, that's a long eight years, though.\n","That makes a big difference.\n","I mean if this is the way it had to be,  this is the best way,  I could possibly do it\n","Well, probably your role\n","and, and the way you are also has changed, though. You know, compared to what it would have been twenty, fifty years ago.\n","but so, I guess uh, in the end, you know, you each take your own situation and you, and you deal with it the best you can,\n","but but, but women I think are a whole, you know sort of riding the course,\n","they're, they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there,\n","I think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation.\n","I think that's being damaged, uh,  a lot.\n","I think,  we're going to see a generation of kids that, you know, are just going to be a little bit, uh, oh, not very nurturing.\n","now some, some women can, can do both.\n","They're very capable of working\n","It's dangerous for the woman, too, to think that she can do that\n","and then when she can't, you know, the failure of that is,  you know, her life sort of falls apart\n","and she doesn't know who she is\n","So many have to work to make a go of it, it seems,\n","and, but I think ones that don't have to, the,\n","it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there.\n","Well, you know, I think that's, that's really, I think it depends on what part of the country you're in.\n","And, and I think that, uh, you know, career women still have a lot of problems here,  with the good old boys,  here in Texas sort of thing,  making career moves\n","but, Uh, you know, in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents, uh, it's just like the way it, it has been for years. I mean, you know, since the days of the pioneers, around here.\n","That's the woman's role,\n","and it, and it's hard for her to, uh, you know, watch her peers be appreciated, I think sometimes,\n","and I always wish there was a balance, you know,  with the one and, and wish she could spend more time with her kids\n","That's, That's where the trouble lies.\n","Some people, some people can adjust and have both, do both well,\n","and others can't.\n","Well, you know, you know, you know, what's always good is sort of a for savings , where they just take money out of you're pay.\n","Well, I guess we all have those feelings.\n","You know, but you need a hobby.\n","It's funny.\n","that's the killer, two apartments,\n","I do recommend the for savings bit.\n","You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone.\n","but, but it's really good.\n","Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house.\n","I think that's right.\n","and I think that's good.\n","that really is.\n","Anyway food is, is, uh, a real life-style kind of thing\n","and some people don't like to do this\n","but I like to uh, cook with my kids.\n","they're so simple.\n","That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too.\n","It's really funny,\n","Uh it's not such a bad idea to think about judges, uh, you know, taking the idea of, uh, uh, sentencing into their hands versus, you know, the jury, especially if it's a highly publicized case such as, uh, you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read, uh, certain, uh, things in regards to cases like the Dahlmer case in Milwaukee and stuff.\n","So it's, it may be an idea to think about, you know, cost.\n","Trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as, uh, they may say they're not biased,\n","but deep down they are against this person or whatever,\n","so, uh, I don't think it's such a bad idea to think about.\n","a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not and, and, uh, not depend so much on the, on the emotions of a particular case, but be able to put it in overall perspective.\n","some of them, some of them do\n","and some of them don't,\n","I didn't think they were either.\n","I thought the sentencing was done by the judge.\n","I mean, it's either guilty or not guilty.\n","I guess in terms of the, uh, you know, having a judge do it would seem to me to be more, more fair and and, uh unbiased.\n","Uh, in terms of doing away with the, with the unanimous jury, I guess, I guess I, uh, would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in, in the trial system.\n","That, that's just a, such a tradition that it's a, that it's got to be a unanimous jury that, uh, I don't know where you'd, where you'd draw the line anywhere else. Uh, you know, uh two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever.\n","But, uh, and, and, I, I, I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a, just a bare majority.\n","That's kind of how I, you know,\n","in certain cases I can see them going, uh, uh, just basically with a judge, guilty or not guilty verdict uh, simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small, uh, maybe, you did a crime that was, uh, burglary or whatever\n","But when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the NATIONAL ENQUIRER or whatever.\n","Uh, it's the idea that person might initially have this thought, well, jeez this person's guilty no matter what.\n","I'm not going to listen to the facts or and, and con their way into, uh, getting past the lawyers and getting through that.\n","But, uh, also there's aspect of cost\n","But, I'm not sure that that's, that that's necessarily required. Uh, you know, by law that it has to be paid.\n","Uh, I suspect that's a, that's a benefit of a bigger company.\n","But, but there are certainly some, Some that, some that wouldn't, uh,\n","Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the U S budget.\n","Well, now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure.\n","It's only getting worse exponentially it seems.\n","There's, uh, maybe some short-term things that they can do\n","and it hurts everybody's pocket, of course,\n","but, um, I know that state has, uh, cutback, uh, raises for a year to help, uh, the, uh, state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition.\n","So there's the potential that perhaps, you know, the U S budget might want to take a look at it's, uh, federal employees or, and take a look at saying, well, let's freeze wages.\n","I mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like, uh, private business has had to do it\n","so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a that's got to be very short term.\n","And the only other avenue that I can think of is, uh, looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying, well, we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money.\n","so. So it gives you idea that,\n","I think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.\n","I mean there was, um, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money to, uh, for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was.\n","And I think that, that maybe more widespread than well, than we'd like to have think.\n","I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days\n","and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing\n","The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.\n","And it's a real big crunch, uh\n","of course, when they get caught then they're, you know, they're guilty of course,\n","but, uh, during that time I'm sure there's hundreds of, uh, thousands of people that are, uh, spending money that does not belong to them.\n","Uh, I think that, oh, politicians talk a lot about waste\n","but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.\n","And I don't think, uh, it's ended up being,\n","but I think it also cost, um, quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war, a lot of things were no longer put to use.\n","I mean it was kind of like, okay, we'll do this during this point and time\n","but after that that's, you know, uh they didn't want to do it anymore.\n","Well, you're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up.\n","and, of course, it, he doesn't know it.\n","Which I think is a good thing.\n","plus, uh, you know the safety factor and stuff.\n","And he's, cats are usually so independent\n","and that's, that's one real drawback,\n","but you know I guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough\n","you will.\n","You will.\n","they're, they're pretty good.\n","They've got some good good, some good, uh, good players out there.\n","Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job.\n","Most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement,\n","well I guess that's a good point, uh,\n","and especially if you have a family.\n","Then I think it makes a big difference.\n","and that's, that's good.\n","Oh, well, I guess, retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so\n","Well, and that's an individual thing.\n","it's hard to follow.\n","It's very good.\n","It, it's probably very much a woman's uh, show.\n","I thought it was, you know,\n","and it had such a good story, too.\n","I thought that was wonderful.\n","unless you're really into computers, you and software, you probably wouldn't be interested,\n","if you're up then\n","You know, a lot, a lot of people don't take newspapers at all.\n","and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial.\n","Well, I wouldn't think I would really say that that's not true, because uh, it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates,\n","and, so, uh, news stations always tell the story from a certain angle\n","and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions.\n","You may never get the truth,\n","but you'll have a variety to choose from.\n","and I, I thought that was particularly interesting in the, the Gulf War, that there were pieces of information that, that were apparently, uh, leaked just as a, as, as, uh, a ploy.\n","if you're around the home, though and, and, and can watch T V and read the paper, the problem is, is that about twenty minutes of news radio, or thirty minutes is\n","that's what's interesting is the C N N, uh,\n","actually I think channel eight is probably,\n","do you, do you, do you seem to,\n","and I think he has legitimate argument.\n","But I think that, I think that, that from a, a justice standpoint, because we have the option of not watching that station.\n","Uh, I'm not sure I, I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs\n","but I think that, uh, in some cases this should be some real opportunity and, and some diversity, and and this kind of thing\n","And, uh, there for a few days and watch the news and, and think Dallas really does have, have quite good news.\n","like all of the stations seem to be pretty good,\n","It is interesting though,\n","it becomes a little of personality.\n","In fact, the, the guy that was on, the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, oh, long time ago, twenty years or so, even longer than that. Twenty-one, twenty-three years ago or so, twenty-four, anyway long time ago\n","and that's interesting.\n","That's, that's what the T V stations do.\n","they're trying to get ratings.\n","And I think, if we remember that, that they're out after the ratings.\n","So that really effects how they report the news.\n","There've been some interesting subject that they've called about.\n","I think it's good.\n","And I think that's what helps, you know, that in the warning that you have a drug program, the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs, actually go\n","and then usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything.\n","so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee.\n","So that, that's the only thing, I think, that might be a little bit of a problem.\n","that's a good point,\n","That would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive\n","It's got to be, if you have a drug testing program,\n","it's got to be with a very, very good agency.\n","You don't just have some local group do it.\n","It's got to be a highly qualified agency.\n","you don't want to do that.\n","It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check.\n","And that would be good for any company that does it, and not to have just a very casual thing.\n","It's got to be with a, you know, first class, totally independent agency. Not local of course.\n","Ours, I think, well I think it was in the south somewhere,\n","I think that's really good.\n","that's not right.\n","It's really an illness, or whatever you want to say that it is.\n","You know, it's a weakness and all,\n","and who, all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another.\n","And I think that those people that have that and however they got into it,\n","It's usually not a one time accidental thing, I don't think.\n","it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that's best way to avoid trouble, from what I can gather.\n","Fantastic experience.\n","It's a fantastic experience.\n","The key thing that I think, that we try to do, is that bring all the friends over here.\n","Have our house as a place where they can come at any time, so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome\n","and they're always over in someone else's house.\n","I think that's a really good thing to encourage.\n","And then you can keep an eye, you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want.\n","But at least you see what's going on,\n","and you always have your house welcome, then your children think that, you know, you're cool parents and all that.\n","Be a, be a great experience really.\n","It just, to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that.\n","And it's very, very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust.\n","it helps you feel, I think comfortable with your car and feel like, it's not so, scary if, um, your driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might, you think, well, I've, I've been under that hood\n","I think it's important that everyone know, you know, basically how, how the darn engine works,\n","Sounds good.\n","and they changed quite a bit.\n","you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that.\n","It was sort of just to um, go protest,\n","and, uh, just, everybody be damned and live with some one,\n","and, you know,  social morals were a little bit lacking.\n","I know that, uh, in, in the early seventies, uh, I think women were the first people to, to make a move as far as individuals.\n","Um, uh, before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like, uh, black people, or, you know, just large, large groups of people,\n","it was more, it was more civil rights oriented, or race oriented rather than gender based,\n","and I think, I think the women's movement kind of brought in individual lives where you had women's movements\n","and you had gay movements,  and just the smaller groups of people.\n","And I think since then is, is when a lot of the women's roles have started to change.\n","and some of the other stuff that, um, I think that changed it, you, uh, when I first got out of college fifteen years ago, they were always saying well, if you, if you were assertive you were a libber,\n","or you were aggressive not assertive and independent.\n","So I think that's good.\n","I think that, uh, you know, you can just look at home life and see, I've been talking to a lot of people about education and things,  and, and what, what, what affects the school system\n","and I think that a big thing that effects it is that the mother is not home anymore,  um, like she used to be.\n","She used to be kind of a, kind of a, a rock, you know,  in the house,\n","but I think that, um,  society's really going to have to get used to it.\n","And they're not quite used to it yet\n","A lot of the things, um, the demographics do,\n","I mean, there are more,\n","but, a lot of the things that brought feminism, I mean there are just more women in, in, in the demographics, just generally,  in the United States, in terms of being,\n","So, I guess that's a big change in terms of, just, um, the attachments that women feel like they need to have, the dependency,  their self-identity is stronger.\n","it's, it's just really not there anymore.\n","And that, that has to do with, you know, the women getting out and other women seeing, uh, women seeing other women, you know,  out in the corporate world.\n","That's like, oh, I can do that.\n","she's probably,\n","nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men.\n","and what you'll find is,\n","but this is probably typical of the women's movement too,  is the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway, if you want to go back to school.\n","And I mean, so when you're saying quick, um, I think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine,  is thinking that, um, they have to do you know, sort of,  I call kind of, I call it a chewing syndrome.\n","They have to eat real fast\n","they have,  they have to, rapidity of speech,\n","they have to just go through everything.\n","And you'll find that probably by the time your twenty-eight, thirty, if you haven't slowed down,  something will slow you down.\n","Um, because it's just, you find out that you're really not, um, smelling the roses,\n","and I know that sounds trite,  and all that.\n","I think, I think a lot of, uh, people probably feeling that way,\n","I know, I'm probably feeling that way because it's, everything's geared towards young.  You know\n","and whether I want to realize it or not, everything on television is young,  young, young, young.\n","You can't be a model after thirty,\n","you can't do this after twenty, you know\n","and,  everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen.  You know,\n","and so I'm going, I'm so old\n","and, um, it's just individual choices.\n","but what you find is you don't compare the woman, because you just get into trouble.\n","It's all independent and choices.\n","I mean,  I think that's the world today.\n","not a lot of people,\n","Here's what you\n","and those people probably\n","that's even better.\n","it worked out fine.\n","Then this will probably,\n","I mean this isn't really excellent Italian food,\n","That sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great\n","you're not going to believe this\n","It wasn't that bad,\n","actually it's very good it's all of these run adult males,\n","So it wasn't too bad it really wasn't\n","but I was more in the mood for french toast any way\n","The food is probably,\n","the food is great.\n","but I think that some of it's over priced.\n","and, Oh, it's pretty good as far as Chinese,\n","Just to die for exactly.\n","It's really sad isn't it cause it's hard to get them away from junk then.\n","Well, that's all right as long as,\n","you sound like you're doing pretty well with four children.\n","and I think that that would make them drool any way.\n","and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing.\n","It was one of these you have bad experience and,  say I don't think I'll come back here.\n","where you felt like,  like when you're in a bad part of Italy or something.\n","And none of it has been good\n","Uh, but a lot of the other ones that have, are professional, uh,\n","I'd say fifty percent of, you know, my peers that I'm, in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're, you know, going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade.\n","there must be some good service out there if you  really look and pay for it.\n","So you're starting from the from the baseline.\n","And, and I guess, uh, because of your, um, your, uh, profession.\n","So, I think that's something that couples need in going  into this.\n","But, but the thing is, if you have this flextime and that, you might be able to do something similar to what I did.  Which is you know, be there short times\n","You were  fortunate.\n","It was constantly, no, I don't want him,  to explore anything.\n","When you deal with issues like that, uh, in terms of family building through adoption, uh, and then you have people responding to you, well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare.\n","I mean  your kids need you\n","Well, they need a schedule I think.\n","I don't think the United States,\n","Well, that's the same thing.\n","it just seems the United States does not provide for either child care or or elder care, as I call it.\n","Uh, and we're just not set up for that.\n","But, but still, you know, it was much better than being shipped to\n","I think we're we're too, too much towards it's somebody  problem, you know.\n","It's easier\n","and I agree with that.\n","what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown\n","but you can probably empathize with this.\n","and I just don't think there is a day, a good daycare system.\n","I, I think that certainly there is a role, uh, for this type of help.\n","And, and as long as one can, can supervise it and, and, you know, make it work in, into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or or, or, uh, giving it, you know, the whole job to somebody else to take care of.\n","it's  in tandem then.\n","One of the things that is a problem is that, uh, in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers.\n","Uh, it's just, you know, it's so low\n","there seem, there are several, mothers who stay home.\n","it's probably not completely legal\n","maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids.\n","And I mean that's another possibility\n","and, you know, you might want to stay home one year\n","and some other lady might want to stay home for a, a few years\n","And that's the way you have to, uh,\n","He must be smart.\n","But for the most part, uh, with the extended family, you know, you can usually find somebody. Which is much like our neighbor you know, to, sharing responsibility.\n","I do not think he was in combat,\n","And, uh, I, I, I, I really do not think that we did those young men right.\n","I think that, uh, Desert Storm, shows a lot of learning since that time.\n","Well, the armed forces did so much to, you know, Agent Orange,\n","they did so much to their own people all during that time.\n","You know, and they they take a, even now, uh, they take a free hand as far as medicine and, uh, you know, how they treat the war casualties, you know.\n","If you come back and your leg is blown off, you know, or, or it is hanging by a thread, they still can't put it back together now.\n","But, But what they do afterwards and how they rehabilitate you.\n","Well, you know, one of the most troublesome things that I have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast Asians into this country since that conflict.\n","Uh, not so, much that I say, I do not want you here.\n","But there is just such a surge of southeast Asians.\n","It has affected the culture of this country, uh, very much.\n","Well, uh, the culture is changing.\n","Look how much more Oriental food we have, restaurants now, for example.\n","Uh, even ten years ago, there were not that many.\n","A lot of shops are, are operated by southeast Asians.\n","A lot of people have complained in the schools.\n","There is a culture change there.\n","The southeast Asians seem to be very hungry,\n","there seem to be very studious.\n","And, uh, tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them, which is not bad.\n","Not really.\n","Uh, but it might in the long run you can see where scholarships, for example, uh, even jobs. Uh, jobs that would normally go to an American, with a lesser education, might be going to, to some of these people here.\n","And that is all a result of, of, of Vietnam.\n","And, and you see a lot of, a lot of men that were over there, brought families back.\n","Well, they are probably not doing very well at all.\n","Because I know there is, there is still people even in the Dallas area.\n","There are, there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from, uh, Vietnam.\n","That would be an interesting concept.\n","And, uh, and, as is really a big waste because they didn't, they didn't win,\n","and, and all they did is run and hide.\n","And they were not really fighting, you know,\n","it, it would have been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam.\n","But, and I am not even sure who was involved more. Whether it was China or Russia.\n","You know, they were pouring, they were pouring weapons in there and, and advising, well, digging tunnels for them. You know,\n","and there is no way that they could ever catch them.\n","Well, I think the terrain had a lot to do with the, the success of Desert Storm as opposed to that in Vietnam.\n","Well now, even, I think even now, and in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job.\n","Because they could, they could kill all those plants, you know, which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on.\n","But, and the, and the Corps of Engineers I think do a better job now, like they did in Desert Storm.\n","Part of it is that, part of it is technology.\n","But when, when, When you get into trouble like that in a place like Vietnam, you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into,\n","and you say, \"Never more.\"\n","And, and you overcome those problems,\n","and you are prepared next time.\n","I think that is one of the reasons that they have, they have pretty much avoided getting involved in South America.\n","Because look what happened when they were looking for Noriega,\n","and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him, you know.\n","He probably just went right down into a tunnel.\n","Well, I know that, uh, from a personal standpoint, people was one of the finest assets that we lost.\n","We did not actually physically lose them.\n","They did not lose their lives,\n","but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had.\n","Uh, being entirely different people.\n","I had dinner Monday night with a Vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had.\n","That is a long time to suffer.\n","And they, they really need,\n","everybody that has, that has stood there,\n","in Vietnam I think it was much closer contact.\n","You stand there with a rifle and blow a, a piece of somebody apart, or blow their head off,\n","and that has to affect you if you are human, you know.\n","So they had to work all that, that anger out, and the, and the nightmares that come along with it.\n","I do not, I do not really think that anybody can ever forget that,\n","but they can, they can reason and, and try to adjust to, to why they were there.\n","Well, you see that is what the veterans are so angry about now.\n","But that does not undo the ones that were done.\n","And that is what makes the veterans angry.\n","On the other hand, you know, you can be angry about something for a very long time,\n","or you can say, \"Well, that is the way it is,\" and go on with your life.\n","And that, and that was, that was in the, in the era when Kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything, you know.\n","And he just, he did not want to be in it any more than, than what we started out in August with Desert Storm.\n","And then it just blew up into the war.\n","Well, it has been that way for a very, very long time, though.\n","There, there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world.\n","we should not have maybe gotten involved.\n","But if we did, we certainly should have supported our people who were there.\n","More so supported them when they got home.\n","And, uh, I am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part.\n","and I think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times.\n","More than, what was, APOCALYPSE NOW\n","I think so.\n","Well, I think so.\n","Well, I think they're useful,\n","I think they're in some instances they're, they're over used,\n","without them knowing how to use it properly, it slows them down, more than it helps them accomplish something.\n","They spend more time messing with the P C than they would actually accomplishing the tasks that they're trying to do if they didn't have a P C at all.\n","And you really have to be able to type pretty fast before, you know, before it really saves time.\n","And you have to, you know, be familiar with it,\n","like there're so many different software packages, it, you have to be familiar with the one that you're going to be using most.\n","A lot of times, uh, people know about half of the capabilities of a package that they should know to actually be able to use it properly,\n","and so they waste more time with their trying to, uh, figure out how to do, you know, other things, than they would if they, if they actually understood what they were trying to do.\n","You know, like, uh, they want to, to format a report a certain way\n","and if they really understood the capabilities of the package they could, they could do that in about, you know, half the time that they spend trying to figure out how to do it without spending the time to learn the package properly.\n","A lot of times they, they, they do it manually on the computer, which just really is a waste of time,\n","and then, if they ever have to change anything in that, in that, in the document, they have to go back and redo it all manually, whereas if they had learned the package properly to start with and had set it up correctly, the package would do that for them whenever they wanted to make a change,\n","Sometimes they don't, uh, they don't think that they can get any information out of the manual.\n","Some manuals aren't really designed very well.\n","It's better to learn it directly from the manual.\n","Well, I think so.\n","Especially when you have to trouble shoot some things.\n","There's a lot of really good I B M compatibles, too.\n","So you don't have any benefits at all to talk about.\n","you normally just try to sell them on your, uh, aptitude and not, you know, well how much vacation do I get\n","After you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go, is that all that's in there.\n","but, you know, that's not always a real, for sure kind of thing.\n","especially with this one, you know, it kind of goes up and down.\n","but you hate to have it fluctuate\n","Doesn't quite feel as good.\n","Which, a lot of places make you work like ten years or so,  before you get that much.\n","You are very, very much aware of what goes on.\n","Now, see that is a nice attitude to go into.\n","Uh, it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity\n","and there is no chance of, uh, good companionship or doing anything.\n","I think that is a stigma and an I, and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences.\n","Well, that is because they wait until the children make those choices, they choose to not make those, choices themselves.\n","Their dining room looks like, you know, Luby's Cafeteria.\n","Oh, I am certainly very much for a nursing home\n","It is expensive.\n","It is costly.\n","See if they could, could get this idea across though, better than what it is, you, know.\n","I think it is a wonderful interim place,\n","it is a place that you do not have to struggle with hospital, problems\n","and yet it is not, you know,\n","It, It depends upon the individual.\n","There has to be consideration taken on everything.\n","And I think you would shop for a nursing home, just like you would shop for a church, or a doctor or anything else.\n","you would look into it thoroughly and, do, do the best job you could in choosing one.\n","When you get to the point where you are in trouble, and you have got to have that help, you are in no position to make those choices.\n","and you do not have the time to look,\n","most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity.\n","I think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they are going to be needing those facilities one day, and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with community service.\n","Uh. Well, one of the things, I think that is most desirable for the elderly and that is routine.\n","Routine and, uh, constancy.\n","I do not think they pay, the nursing home staff sufficiently, to, to get the dedication that they have in some other profession,\n","and that is sad, because, I think the health profession is one of the most critical,\n","But , for some reason people resist, uh, the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing, you know.\n","It seems to be a resistance.\n","Care for the elderly and care for the children, I cannot imagine a more costly and a more, a more, uh, better area to invest, your money.\n","But there seems to be a resistance.\n","You are preserving your heritage and your future there.\n","And, as a matter of fact, I do not see why they do not have children's programs in nursing homes.\n","they said about magazines.\n","and you may be familiar with it from Wisconsin, is called COUNTRY.\n","Gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things.\n","but you kind of just put the magazine away\n","and you never read it again unless there's some big article in there that you're going to keep for your kids,\n","exactly it sounds exactly like what we did\n","Well, you sound like you, That's the thing, you sound like you have the facilities to do that.\n","and uh, you're right, the leaves are beautiful,\n","and very often, like, you know, in my bills, also, magazines and bills, and they'll, come out just stinking the whole thing.\n","and I thought, Well, I'll give it a try again, because you get tired of one magazine,\n","and you need to try a change.\n","now, it's, it's pretty neat music that they came out with,\n","the old, old country,\n","let's just put it that way, hearing, anyway,\n","like you mentioned before, the name the college and university can, can give you and another thing that, uh, another reason why I chose that was the, the finances.\n","And that, that your children can use the benefits of that university.\n","So I, I think that the, uh, you know, once you get past, uh, the initial stages of it, that there's different options you can use\n","and, and, uh the student loans are, are good options.\n","and, and as you're well aware that tuition's not,\n","and I think they're better people because of it,\n","they're much more responsible.\n","Well, I think so,\n","it puts you out on your own\n","and and in a time after high school, um, there's kind of a selfishness,\n","I mean, teenagers in our country are kind of, kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and, and things like that\n","A lot of people they flunk out\n","or they get, they just get so excited to be away from home, they just spend all there time partying\n","and they do a lot of things to themselves that, that we really don't want our young people to be doing\n","that's true.\n","I think, I think this was, this was a very interesting topic uh, because it's something that, you know, we don't talk about in this country probably enough.\n","because we're so, we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and, um, having people like\n","And they're preoccupied with, drinking.\n","today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented,\n","and everything has to be an immediate reward\n","and it has to be fun.\n","And they don't have a goal,\n","they don't have a goal,\n","they don't have an interest in their own field of study.\n","They're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash.\n","And, and I just sort of think that's ridiculous.\n","with with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and, uh, you know, the, the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and, and how come everybody is a lawyer, you know, you know\n","There's just too many people.\n","Not enough people want to do that to, for, uh, because of a service that they could provide.\n","You know, if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country, um, but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to, be rich.\n","you saw, statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run.\n","That's kind of sad.\n","I think we should have stayed longer.\n","but I think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do.\n","I think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now.\n","And it's almost like they're killing each other off\n","and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all like\n","Well, I think, I don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it, um.\n","It wasn't ours.\n","I just mean that, that, the world in general\n","We've got to talk so it's just, just as well we argue.\n","I think we should have helped the, the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more, than, rather than just quitting where we did.\n","But I think that's almost impossible, next to impossible.\n","Oh, he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country.\n","We don't have the money for that.\n","and it's really interesting.\n","So that will give you some idea of where I'm at.\n","It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs.\n","It is.\n","If you like doing everything twice\n","Texas is, much worst for the drugs.\n","I mean, it was bad enough every place else,\n","When you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones.\n","And that does make a big difference.\n","it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow then it's kind of tough.\n","You know, everybody's not FATHER KNOWS BEST.\n","well none of us are.\n","Let's face it, you know, we're not none of us like they portray it on those shows.\n","I mean, life's much more difficult than that.\n","I, mean, the, the, the capability to, uh, create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the, uh, the mental capacity to raise them\n","It's, it's not easy.\n","And, uh, as you know, with five children it takes a lot of work.\n","Even, if, even if someone's home all the time, there's still a lot of things that have to be done.\n","And it's, kind of a waste of a person.\n","you know if you're working, if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty-one hours a week, there's not much time left to spend with,\n","Well, it puts a strain on everybody, your wife and your family.\n","And, the only thing you can remember is to try and stay together as much as you can, because it's very easy to, uh, become, go your own direction when you're when you're working so hard and going to school, too.\n","That's quite a change.\n","It seems like they get incredibly small\n","So that sounds great,\n","They're, they're sure getting their people out,\n","for as far as, um, I would think the, probably the, uh, worst substance that's probably, um,\n","what causes the most air pollution is probably the car\n","and, uh, whether or not, um, they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, uh, train or, or something like that\n","it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility.\n","or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing,\n","so it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, I think the majority of the people do not carpool.\n","or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car then they're, they're stuck,\n","you're definitely right,\n","And people don't want to give it up\n","but now I think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and to change the car itself\n","but, uh, you know, I, I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent\n","the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season\n","but those are natural\n","but, uh, I think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that\n","it's not a bad idea.\n","and, uh, but if they are polluting the air, they need, do need to have them fixed\n","uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, I'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it\n","but it's uncomfortable\n","It's probably happened to millions of people,\n","because if you take it into a service station, they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars\n","so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, Hey, that's that's right there.\n","I think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt,\n","Monday night's pretty good with MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN.\n","I just, I love that, all those, that two hours\n","it, it was pretty good,\n","They have some British comedy that we've, we've really liked,\n","British comedy is very fast,\n","you really have to listen\n","They're real good,\n","but they do come on kind of late,\n","I'm not into watching sports.\n","and you know, this is a, you know, this is too much\n","Saturdays and Sunday, this is fine,\n","those are pretty good but true to life,\n","I mean, some of the,\n","But very true to life,\n","Well um, I, I just think the way that things are going that, um, it would be good for young people to go ahead and have, um, dedicate themselves to at least something.\n","I know, like the Mormon religion, you know, they require two years of service, uh, missionary service\n","and, um, so, but I think it would be good for all young people you know, to be able to, to do something like that um, so that, um, you know, I don't know, I just feel it would be good for them to do that.\n","I, I thought it would be good, too,\n","but I did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps because not all young people would have, uh, what it takes to go like that because I think it takes a certain person to, to be able to do something like that,\n","but there's a lot of other public service things that could be done.\n","and, and even, even in our home towns there's a lot of um, public service things that they could do uh, you know, drug rehabilitation and and alcohol and, and just, uh, helping old people, and, um, uh, you know, helping cripple, just helping somebody else\n","and I think that art of giving is something that, um, we don't have very much any more.\n","I think it would be that.\n","It'd be good character builder.\n","Um, because there's so many, um, kids who have, uh, you know, so much money and so much free time and, uh, nothing to do, um, and nothing to give their time to.\n","Um, they don't even have a direction to give their, their time to,\n","so I think it would be really good for people to, um, to be able to give their time in, in, uh, some kind of public service, uh, even in our government, you know, as, uh, aids to, uh, you know, Congress, uh, people\n","it would be, it'd be really good I think.\n","I agree with you.\n","This is something that, um, like you say, is it's character building um, you know, learning how to, to give to others, and being less selfish\n","Well, I think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like, you know, what what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood some of the people, how they live\n","and I think, uh, young people are so, um, uh, focused just on themselves and their activities, and whose going out with whom, et cetera that, uh, you know, to get a taste of what the real world is actually about doing that public service would be great.\n","because that's one thing that's hard, with young people, you, you can't tell them how things are\n","they have to see for themselves\n","now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years,\n","I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done.\n","I would think so, like right after, um, high school you know, even if it was the, the, their, um, that summer right after high school you know, three months,\n","Of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction you know, they, their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go and something,\n","course now Peace Corps, that couldn't be done of course, until they were done with school\n","You know, something that out, that was outside of, uh, outside of school\n","you know, right, right after you graduate from, um, high school, because a lot of people are just, um, uh, Well gee whiz, what do I do now if they're not focused on going to college,\n","and, uh, you know, having that, that, uh, gung ho plan uh, that's, you know, setting their life goals.\n","Kind of an in-between time.\n","so to me, see that would be the, the, uh, the greatest time for, um, you know, teenagers to, to do that, would be right after they graduated from high school.\n","But as for its being required you know, we're just not, we're not based on, on that, uh type of a system. Um.\n","and like I said, not, now all young people should be able to do something,\n","but not all certainly would be geared to, even the, the Mormon boys that go out, not all of them go,\n","I mean it's disaster if they don't go,\n","but but some of them are not,\n","they're just not made to do that type of thing\n","and they just aren't able to do it.\n","it'd be good\n","but like I said, requiring it would be, uh,\n","You know, you see cockroaches crawling around and everything, you know.\n","where you don't feel rushed, you know\n","and you can just relax, and stay as long as you want.\n","it was really nice.\n","That is probably very fortunate for you.\n","and I don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have.\n","and it's really, it's tempting when you come home from work\n","and you're tired\n","and, you know, you just are tempted to give in to that,\n","and it costs a lot of money to do it too.\n","You know, it adds up\n","and it's not healthy,\n","That's kind of the way I have felt.\n","Course, we only have mostly the representation given in the media,\n","You really do have to study to get yourself, uh, up to par with what is truly going on\n","and that takes a lot of research\n","and  and people today are very busy\n","and uh, and that is an excuse because we are, we are always, uh,\n","and, uh, you hopefully find that you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard.\n","And unfortunately they are not.\n","And, uh, it's really a dilemma, uh, that we find ourselves in, I believe. Uh,\n","and, uh, and, uh, I also feel, especially in the presidential elections that, uh, since we're back on the old system of electoral votes and, or that, and that you don't necessarily, your vote doesn't necessarily elect president.\n","they just want to see how close the electoral votes are with the public votes.\n","it's awful,\n","and, and it's hard to feel like one person,\n","but I know that it's important,\n","and I know that, you know, people can make a difference,\n","but it's hard to, to face the corruption, like you say, and, uh, and to know what you're up against.\n","and, uh, I'm glad that that happened and everything\n","Well, I know that when you're in a smaller community,\n","and, uh, you can really, uh, feel comfortable in, uh, evaluating that, uh, candidate by, uh, that method.\n","Now, I wouldn't say that about the larger cities though, and the, and the country on, like, the presidential.\n","Uh, I mean, they've got people that are running that are admitted, uh, criminals and admitted crooks.\n","And, uh, without the Lord, they can't do it.\n","and it's not very likely.\n","Well, I believe that the, um, the voice, that, uh, initialized this call asked about, uh, if we thought that it should be something that should be put into action.\n","like the if, should the government make it universal or something like that.\n","I, I, I, I would be committed to that,\n","and if you didn't have any choice on, you know, in who you go to,\n","Or to change even, like if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service.\n","and the expense of that, yes.\n","And that, that, something like that, you know, I thought, if you couldn't change or look elsewhere, you know, for help, if you\n","I don't know how that program works, you know, if you can do that.\n","Well, I would, I would think that they would have that as part, part of the benefit to the health care program, that you would indeed have a choice that you could select that individual yourself.\n","And I'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor, and hopefully that they would have their, um, accreditations there too.\n","I guess that's, that's primarily was one of my thoughts, you know, because, you know how government is\n","but those guidelines have to be set up,\n","and I think they should be voted on by the public.\n","For them to have a choice on if they're in favor of it or not.\n","It, it would.\n","And of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be,\n","and, um, I think that's primary, uh or an individual perhaps being single.\n","Um, I'm not sure what else that, uh, we could address, uh, on health care, uh, other than the fact, I think, uh, the eyes and the ears and the, uh, whole self should be, uh, uh, included in all of that.\n","Uh, dental, eye care, and, uh, our body as a whole should be included in that because there are so many avenues that needs to be, um, undertaken in a program like that.\n","Well, if he's pleased with it, I guess that's, uh, the bottom line.\n","So, but I, I would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something.\n","cause there's always that opposite story there.\n","Oh If you have your health, you're wealthy.\n","You really are,\n","That's a nice state,\n","that's a real nice state,\n","it's very lovely,\n","it's a very lovely state.\n","So I suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in, you know, like more populated areas as far as, uh the doctors that are available\n","That has broadened so much also.\n","That is, the fields that, you know, are opening up are, um, just phenomenal.\n","I mean, look at the AIDS, uh, case you know, I mean they, that's a whole new field in itself.\n","It's just, it's an auto immune deficiency\n","but it sure is a dilly one.\n","I still wish they could do more with the cancer situation, though.\n","They, uh, they just don't seem to be,\n","Well, there's guidelines that people have to follow,\n","But a a lot of them don't do these things even,\n","and it doesn't seem to matter.\n","Well, they say second hand smoke and that, is worse than smoking\n","Well, you just have to ban the smoking to their to their little room that they want to,\n","Take their rights away from them, they say\n","Well, it's a bad habit that's,\n","it's a hard one to quit.\n","they say that it is.\n","and they make very good fajitas there in their own, uh, homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful.\n","Especially with butter and honey on them\n","They are, they just, um, they're excellent, uh, excellent food.\n","So, it's, it's really good. All their blackened grill stuff.\n","If you want a really special night out and fish food that's a good place to go.\n","Well, Taco Bueno's good\n","Oh and, and cheap too.\n","of course, it's just so much easier and simpler\n","Oh, now that's surprising because normally they're just, they're real good.\n","it, it's fun.\n","Well, and, um, it's nice for them  not to be alone.\n","And so, so, um, you know, you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen.\n","so you got to be careful\n","But, um, it's really scary,\n","And I know how I feel, how I felt as a provider of child care that, even though you're, you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to, you know, treat them equally and, you know, better, usually, better than your own\n","um, it's not the same,\n","and it made me realize that, um, no one will love your child as much as you and your mother, your and, um, the family\n","and no one will look out, after them,\n","but like you said, you tend to go more for the other one's side just because you are responsible\n","And, uh, by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time,\n","and, there's just not enough to, time in the day to do anything good quality for them,\n","But, uh, just off the top of my head, I, I don't think I see much wrong with it.\n","Um, if I owned a company and I wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that I had, uh, coming in, uh, were trust worthy, et cetera, and so on, I think I would, I would, uh, probably do the random testing just to insure that my company, uh, runs safely and smoothly.\n","Uh, but I suspect it, it very much depends upon the job.\n","There are some jobs where I guess it doesn't really,\n","and it's, it's, it's, if it's not affecting someone's performance then I'm not sure if it's a problem.  If, if, if,\n","like for instance,  Uh, if someone's working on heavy machinery,  or say driving trucks or buses, city buses or something like that.\n","Then that is something that affects the, that affects the community.\n","You know, if you're, you're drinking or on drugs or whatever, you're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands.\n","And then if you're a computer operator and, uh, there's really no big deal,\n","I think, you know,  that maybe it's not necessary.\n","And for me, I think that drug testing, it follows the path that society is going in.\n","If more and more people are using drugs then I think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs.\n","I mean, it's just, it's just where society is right now,\n","and you know, something we have to cope with\n","and I think the drug testing is something that the drug users have to cope with.\n","Well, I think it may, it may, that's in, in that respect, I think it may help a lot.\n","I think it may be pushing people, hopefully push people away from drug use, If they no that, you know. *spelling:know\n","Well, see, if you actually used drugs at all,\n","I mean it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector test.\n","If you don't have anything to hide, you're not going to mind it.\n","And then there are some things that just aren't peoples business,  that come out at that point\n","so I think that a lot of people have trouble with that.\n","But,  that's a fine line to draw.\n","but they would rather have it private,  you know.\n","Like, especially in the case of drinking.\n","Those are just to get, probably to get some sort of, those are to get the shock value out of you.  Shock.\n","But with them they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping,  around and being fidgety,\n","It can be shocking\n","and,  shock you.\n","Big jump there. But, yeah,\n","I think it's their way of saying how well you do,  in a shock situation without worrying about,  stuff like that.\n","I wouldn't worry about that.\n","because in society a lot of people are taking drugs.\n","There is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives.\n","But they take a lie detector test or a drug test, or whatever\n","and the stuff that happened to them, you know, five years ago comes up\n","and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better.\n","You know, when they might be actually trying to,  improve their lives.\n","That's, uh, you know, it, it could blow things right away for them, you know.\n","Unless they say, well, look, unless they walk in, they could walk in and say, look, I did do drugs a year ago,\n","Because, I mean then, although then, they can't legally discriminate, I think on the basis .\n","it makes you think.\n","So I think that's real good.\n","Well, I think we pay too much in taxes.\n","Well, I think they waste what we pay.\n","I think they waste what, all the money that we pay\n","And what you find out is, there's, one evil is the same as the other.\n","So they get you coming and going.\n","So it's really kind of sad,\n","but it just seems like, if you're strictly middle income, it seems like you get hit the worst.\n","but they're making money\n","then they should pay taxes then.\n","and just somehow it doesn't seem, you know,\n","In a way, it's almost like he had so much debt that, uh, filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know.\n","it's not as bad as being single and divorced,\n","but it's sort of like, if you have like X point five children and earn, you know, you kind of get hit with, you know,\n","I, I mean, it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage, because,\n","Well that's not too bad.\n","but it's not enough, you know.\n","You know, it doesn't even, it's not even,\n","I guess it's an easy thing to do.\n","well, it's not little any more.\n","but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy.\n","And the people think the income is really great in some of those areas\n","but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live\n","and, uh, of course, most of the homes are, you know, fairly nice,\n","they're, uh, done up fairly nice, uh,\n","Well, prices have come down on the homes, the duplexes.\n","Well, you're really not too bad.\n","you can have them in,\n","you can go out.\n","You have more of a choice,\n","you're not pressed upon as bad.\n","Pittsburgh's housing economy, I think it's holding it's own.\n","it's real pretty up there.\n","it's real nice.\n","And the neighborhoods are stable you know.\n","when you come to this part of the country, we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing.\n","and what happens is, uh, you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in Yeah,\n","you have to stop some place,\n","A lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house\n","You know, they buy a place\n","and they just hate the area.\n","but it's still not going up.\n","and, and it's hard to sell the properties.\n","I mean it would probably be like your house on, uh, you know, a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something.\n","but it's still, it's still not that private.\n","to tell you the truth, um, I think that if you can keep that, that way, you know, kind of like a homestead,\n","Well, I think our tastes are fairly similar,\n","I don't know whether they think by, you know, freezing them up overnight, then they can save electricity during the day or something.\n","Although the fact that most of the ones I know are in the government and they're not meeting the public it, I find it a little bit strange that their priorities would, would be to spend this money here\n","I mean, I suppose if you were a, a, more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up.\n","I mean, you can look businesslike in, in a the same pant suit you would, you know wear for other things.\n","But otherwise, now, I'm, I guess we're both pretty practical\n","Well, uh, I'm, I'm certainly under the, uh, uh, the influence of the idea that, that the government needs to have less control on what, uh, what the citizens do,\n","although I do see this as a, uh, something that definitely needs to be taken care of.\n","Whether that, whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or the, the hands of the, hands of the government is a, you know, a, a different question I think, as far as I'm concerned.\n","Yet but, but at the same time, I don't think, uh, that should be governed by by the government, uh, per se.\n","I think it should be more by the private institution.\n","I think that the corporations should, uh, do all that.\n","They should, uh, have drug screening before they hire an employee\n","I, you know, I would even think that, uh, uh, I could, in theory take that a a, you know, a step further and say anybody in any job, you know, if the corporation felt like, uh,\n","and this is why, I mean, uh, drugs are the biggest problem, I think to face America today.\n","I mean it's what drives crime,\n","it's what drives, uh, uh, any sort of, of, uh, uh, pain and discomfort in the world, or in America I think is is somewhat, uh, uh, driven by drugs\n","and I think that, uh, were corporations and, uh, private industry to take, uh, take command in this situation, that maybe, maybe we might have some, some control over that.\n","if you can't work, then you can't be a little bit harder to take, take drugs or whatever,\n","Course, that might up crime, you know, when, uh, people go in and steal your television and and sell it just because they can't, they can't work anymore, you know.\n","but you got to have a, a safe work place.\n","That's all there is to it.\n","That, uh, you can't, you can't have it any other way.\n","if it's a policeman and he's working with, uh, the public and he has a, and has a gun in his holster or, or even, you know, if it's a guy at McDonald's cooking a burger, I think, they're dangerous in either situation.\n","I think it's, it's more frequent now.\n","It's probably like forty, fifty percent.\n","something that kind of concerns me is, uh, you know, you and I are tested for, for whatever work we happen to do.\n","Because, because a lot of them are, you know, they're hypocritical.\n","like the, the money laundering scams. All that was drug related.\n","So, and that cost us, the country, you know, billions of dollars.\n","I, I can't see, I can't see how we can expect the, you know, uh, uh, people working in the, in, in America to, uh, to put any trust into our political officials if they don't, you know, uh,\n","just doesn't make sense to have them to, to worry about legislation unless they're doing that themselves.\n","well that's, that's a good thing, because lot of people don't pay at the end of the month\n","And that's when you get into expenses.\n","and you get in over your head.\n","and it's really useful.\n","well, I see that as an advantage to a credit card, also\n","that you can can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself.\n","So I think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations.\n","because sometimes, uh, there's times when you may, maybe couldn't take advantage of something\n","but with a credit card you can.\n","Almost too much so.\n","I am surprised they would bring anything over here.\n","and,  it's very interesting, very interesting,\n","and it's been very well done\n","The only problem is, it keeps you pretty busy, keeping everything going,\n","and you seem to be making out all right.\n","Oh, I, I think the trends are going back to spending more time with families.\n","I think parents are definitely, uh, spending more and more time.\n","I don't think they're leaving them with baby-sitters, you know.\n","I think, I think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there  for about, uh, I don't know, eight or nine years.\n","Seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a deal.\n","Parents kind of went and did their thing,\n","kids did their thing. Yes,\n","When, when your own children are growing up, you just take them for granted\n","and you go ahead and do your thing\n","so I'm going to have difficulty with this topic.\n","Um. Then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days.\n","I don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that.\n","I think a lot of families now, they probably don't spend enough time together.\n","You know, whether their parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together\n","and, and I think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is being destroyed.\n","Just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like fishing\n","and, uh, because that I think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot.\n","And the communication helps you build on your, uh, helps just, just build your family.\n","You know, that's good sometimes because you need to, you know, get away.\n","But, um, I don't think you, you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of, of losing your the family unit.\n","Because then you never get to know them either.\n","And once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve, you know, you've pretty much lost them\n","Well, I think they can turn off the T V for one thing. And, and go out and do stuff, you know.\n","but, I think that's that is a big problem. The television\n","and it's, it's too static, you know,\n","it's something that you can do\n","but there's no thinking involved, no motion, you know,\n","and I think, think that's another reason why people are, uh, so health conscious now is because America's becoming really a couch potato society.\n","You know, people aren't doing anything just sitting around, you know, no thinking involved\n","and now, I think I think people are trying to get out of that.\n","it's becoming really health conscious\n","and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that.\n","And that's probably good, you know,\n","if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that, that also helps.\n","That's also something, you know, family oriented that everyone can do.\n","You've still have a lot of time before she gets up in years\n","and, it, the lake it just seems, is, is completely filled with bass to the point where, you know, normally you go, go fishing for bass, you get a lot of sunfish, or, or cat or whatever, and some other strange stuff. *listen\n","it's a big problem.\n","but all they're good for is the fight.\n","Boy they they really don't want to come out of the water\n","when you, when you have to look in their eyes and, you know, hit them in the head or whatever, that's what you do with a catfish you know, because you have to sever their spinal cord.\n","And, and, and, and, and be careful you don't get stung.\n","and, It's a good deal, too.\n","It's really nice\n","It's real enjoyable.\n","I think we're probably close, though.\n","Or, or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't.\n","And, and they're probably doing it to their benefit, anyway.\n","I would assume that you know, whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in.\n","But it's, it's difficult.\n","and, you know, I think they even have a swimming pool\n","and I mean, different places have different amounts of vacation, I would assume.\n","Some places count the number of hours\n","and some places just sort of believe you.\n","So maybe that covers the topic then.\n","Well, I don't know, the the working conditions, you know, if you could include that in benefits.\n","Some places aren't very safe to work.\n","And, and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you, that you have to work under.\n","Or maybe a uh, not really a benefit, either, but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls.\n","Um, but, you know I suppose some places are, are more stringent about that than others.\n","I think so.\n","And, and, maybe arriving late or something like that, you know,\n","how, how they enforce the rules.\n","I suppose that whenever companies can avoid, um, benefits, it's to the, to, to the benefit of the company\n","and at least, you know, financially in the short run,\n","but I would think they would get a much greater turnover\n","and that people would be dissatisfied\n","they should be able, they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are\n","and how much profit they're making\n","instead of trying to cut everything down *listen\n","and then have everybody be unhappy and, and have a constant turnover of people.\n","I mean, sure, the payroll is lower that way,\n","but I would assume that the productivity is way down, also.\n","the productivity and the training costs,\n","if they have to train the same employee, a new employee every six months, then I don't see how they can save money.\n","You know, and once they once they get somebody good, they ought to hang onto them.\n","And, um, you know, there's pros and cons on both side of that\n","of course, maybe that's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers.\n","But maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be.\n","You know, the individual incidence or something.\n","Oh, well, he's plenty big enough then\n","I I always thought that if you were checking into a day care, that you would be good to get references,  uh, on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there.\n","Because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying, you know,\n","if there was a problem they, they would I think be more ready to tell you what it was.\n","Oh, I think so, because if they were still there, you know they might not,\n","They may not say anything.\n","And, uh, other than how else, how do you judge other than from what others have, uh, what you see, uh, the cleanliness and that type of thing.\n","You can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something,\n","But it would be real difficult to pick you, you know, to find one and decide.\n","But I I think I'll enjoy doing ,\n","I bet you'll have some great experiences with them.\n","I, I think I'll enjoy.\n","Well, they do say you enjoy them more,\n","But they're, the ones that complain a lot are the first\n","um, well I know that they're, they're real cautious about letting Middle Eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism.\n","now I didn't think, I thought the terrorism thing was overstated, I mean,\n","this is not our subject, I guess,\n","but, uh, I, I, I'm concerned that we're letting too many, that we don't have enough controls.\n","I think that, uh, the Asian gangsters that we've let in here\n","and if and the guys from, uh, Cuba, you know, there's a lot of criminals down in Florida that we've let in from Cuba that Fidel pushed off on us,\n","out of all the Asians we brought in, there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from, from Asia\n","and I think that  there's got to be some sort of controls over that.\n","There, I don't think there's much of, much of one, because I'm sure all the people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in.\n","And, uh, most of them, it's just like Australia, most of them were criminals from Cuba\n","and I think that was just an attempt that, that Fidel Castro to undermine, you know the United States to some extent.\n","So he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us.\n","And it's almost the same thing in, in, uh, from Asia, because  a lot, a lot of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the war,\n","but I think that we need to do something with, uh, the immigration of back and forth across Mexico, uh\n","and they, I guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work.\n","I don't uh, I think that we should have good relations with, with Mexico,\n","It is\n","and it isn't.\n","although, the idea of education is an answer to a lot of problems in the world.\n","So I guess it's what they,\n","and maybe that's a benefit to everybody, you know.\n","I never thought that they were much.\n","I feel so bad that we, here in Texas, or certainly the southern part of the United States, uh, California, Texas, and all that, why our kids don't speak fluid Spanish, uh, by junior high, you know as well as us, you know\n","so that we could, wouldn't have the language barrier certainly.\n","That, that, that is a shame that we have this tremendous border of Mexico,\n","We, we we don't really even make an effort to speak Spanish,\n","and that's, you know, one reason that I did it  is because, because whenever you travel anywhere near the border, you know, there more and more people speak Spanish.\n","I guess it's never too late.\n","I think it's mostly concentrated toward the borders,\n","I, I, I think that certainly is a problem.\n","That certainly was interesting,\n","but I guess, I guess if you go back far enough you came over on a boat originally, you know.\n","So we all immigrants, one way or another, well\n","those were laws are unusual.\n","So that doesn't seem fair to the children.\n","sometimes common sense should take over rather than,\n","that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all that you would do it that way.\n","You would think they could at least get a, a, a visa or something until they, uh, get citizenship.\n","I'm sure they want to.\n","I guess you can get work visas pretty easily, uh.\n","Uh, although I guess Europe, now that the Communism is falling apart, that maybe there'll be, won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist countries, uh,\n","I guess Poland now, now is noncommunist\n","so maybe not,\n","maybe immigration from Europe to here will you know slowly, uh, change,\n","maybe it'll be, even out like trade, you know.\n","So many people will immigrate here in the twentieth, at the year two thousand,\n","so many of the people will go back overseas.\n","You know, maybe it will average out,\n","It doesn't, has, doesn't seem so far.\n","so that part is good.\n","It's just, I mean, it's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air\n","and, and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there, and everywhere, it all adds up. *there they're\n","Plus all the problems in the Middle East.\n","Oh, that has to be terrible over there.\n","and you just thought, well, it's obvious that there's a lot going up in the air there,\n","and what comes up, must come down\n","and here you are living ...\n","That just doesn't make too much sense.\n","And I figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste, no matter who does it. and they have shown, some of the industries have been real good at, uh, uh, doing their part in, uh, reducing the amount that they have, *sd\n","Well, um, individual companies and things are so selfish,\n","And their desires to save a few dollars and, and that\n","they don't care about the environmental impact, that they make.\n","they're greedy.\n","It's money, is what is.\n","It's, it's the money\n","They're making fantastic amounts on these things\n","and, uh, even the incinerator, the money and the income that they're going to make off this, is, you know, just astronomical.\n","Seems kind of old to me.\n","and they don't realize these things are going to affect everybody.\n","And if you're older it's not going to affect you that way.\n","You have grandchildren,\n","you have children, uh,\n","Nieces, nephews, whatever, friends.\n","Uh, everybody is going to be affected by it.\n","And we all, you know, need to be willing to help pay a little bit. Like,\n","And I thought, well, it's so much better.\n","Well, I really think it must.\n","I think every,\n","And each is putting out,\n","And that's, all cars are doing that.\n","And it's really polluting the air.\n","And it's also, it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer,  and things,\n","We sure wouldn't want, so much more people suffering from that.\n","And like I said, I think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it, because it's industry.\n","We're paying industry to make the products\n","and, we're helping pay for there making these end products that are, toxic waste.\n","Then, we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace,\n","then they put it in the dump some place\n","and they find out, well, this dump doesn't work\n","so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else.\n","We end up paying for it again.\n","Now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators.\n","And we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted.\n","And, you know, it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there, because, if that water gets contaminated, it will go on down to Pittsburgh.\n","it affects so many people.\n","And it's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this.\n","It's scary\n","It's scary.\n","It's really awful.\n","I mean it's so expensive.\n","You have to really make a lot of money.\n","Uh, bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something.\n","I mean, while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, uh, pollute a lot, uh, if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano, uh, it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all.\n","I think probably the greatest cause is, uh, vehicles, especially around cities.\n","And, it seems like, uh, we're catching all that residue.\n","Um, there doesn't seem to be much emission from them,\n","I notice locally a major problem is Kodak.\n","Um, it's interesting\n","I mean, I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades, light up the sky, photograph the emissions at that point, and, uh, you know,\n","There, there must be, uh, uh, some of the, some of the, uh, larger plants up, uh, up around one hundred twenty-eight.\n","they could do something about, about that, I guess.\n","That seems a little ridiculous.\n","But I, I thought it was up there.\n","So, that's interesting because New Hampshire, and parts of Vermont, um, they showed pictures of, of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain.\n","so it's, it's less than clear.\n","Uh, we can demand, uh, more efficient automobiles for one thing.\n","I still think that's, that's, uh, one of our major causes of pollutants.\n","Uh, how we go about that, it's uh, uh, it's a little bit difficult.\n","I think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers for, for less pollutant vehicles.\n","you I think you need a, a vehicle something like, uh, Ralph Nader, Nader's Raiders, or, where, uh, or, uh, uh, A A R P, which has a lot of members. Uh, if you can get those types of groups.\n","and the new cars it's hardly is, hardly anything.\n","they're better,\n","I mean, they do generate a lot of soot\n","but that at least, that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly.\n","This country seems to be a little behind on that.\n","On the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient.\n","but only because we got used to, uh, single person, single car, driving.\n","A lot of people don't even like to carpool.\n","That'll help, pollution, air pollution,\n","So that's helping.\n","maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe\n","I guess the difficulty would be to, that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again\n","so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something.\n","I mean I guess you could take those off too\n","but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off.\n","You should, uh, pursue that I think, or patent it, you know.\n","that's a good idea.\n","If you could come up with a device that's the thing.\n","But it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that.\n","you're right\n","and that will solve, uh, a lot of problems.\n","I don't know if you, uh, if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that.\n","Uh, but you know a proposal to, uh, uh, I guess the proper authorities,\n","well you might, uh, generate some\n","you might generate some interest in it.\n","But that's, that's a good idea.\n","Other than that I'm not sure what, what individuals can do other than like I said get involved through a group or an organization.\n","That is fabulous.\n","and, uh, it was tremendous.\n","it was just fabulous.\n","I, he, he is really good.\n","that's, that's nice to do, that is.\n","that's not music\n","that is not,\n","but that's not music\n","Well, it's, it's, it's not, it's not music,\n","it's just, it's just, uh, uh, talking in a beat,\n","it is just, it's not exciting at all\n","it doesn't, it doesn't give you relaxation,\n","you can't dance to it,\n","you can't do anything to it\n","they're good.\n","oh, the music in that was fantastic.\n","and, uh it was well worth the price.\n","That, that would be, that would be nice\n","that was good,\n","that had good music in it.\n","I think, I think they're a bit over exposed\n","I get kind, of get tired of every other song being Alabama on the, radio.\n","I, I think, I, I know who that is,\n","I think my parents have have, uh, some of his records.\n","He was the sidekick of Gene Autry I believe\n","I think his name in, in the movie was Froggy\n","that would be great if they weren't too worn out, at the time.\n","Of course, there's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight R P M records.\n","You, you'd, well you'd think there would be.\n","Well, the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because, you have to have that needle, that, uh, particular kind of needle\n","you'd, think there'd be a market for,\n","I'm, I'm sure you could find old players for them\n","but that would cost a fortune, if you could find them that worked\n","Of course, they, you know, just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because, you, you get that scratchy sound.\n","You could kill somebody with them\n","And the ones you buy,\n","and they're just so thin and, flimsy\n","and they just, they're not meant to last, at all,\n","neither are tapes.\n","and so, the best bet, any, these days are compact disk,\n","those things are practically indestructible\n","I think it was better back then to,\n","there's too much T V now\n","and the radio is, you know, more exciting, really, than, than television,\n","it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does\n","Uh, uh, seems like it was on a Friday,\n","Well, I, I think it's a pretty good idea.\n","I think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or helping elderly people.\n","I, I, you know, I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help\n","and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and, and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home\n","and I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea\n","and, or the military for a year or two, wouldn't be bad for,\n","I think it teaches kids how to grow.\n","you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts\n","and they did, do, do do a lot of public service activities,\n","but these days they're not, uh,\n","parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that.\n","that's really great.\n","I, I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations.\n","You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that,\n","and they don't follow it at all, you know.\n","There are very few Scouts go on, and become Eagle Scouts.\n","once they get into junior high it just, not done anymore\n","they, they lose interest.\n","and then when they young, young adults, there's even less interest there.\n","They're more for, I\n","you're absolutely right\n","I think it's a really a good thing.\n","of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help\n","but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country, too.\n","But I think, we ought to start right here at home.\n","uh, I'm not, I'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young people.\n","But, since there is much that needs to be done here.\n","I think that, yeah, I think that we need to really address what we've done here\n","and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook.\n","Well, it's been really good.\n","It, we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing, that they should do sometime.\n","I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming,\n","it's, uh, you know, afterwards, you know,\n","then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, you know.\n","a lot of things do that.\n","it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't, you don't have any excuse.\n","it's too nice,\n","it's been too nice all weekend.\n","I need to start jog something again.\n","I've always of that to be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise,\n","but it's terribly boring,\n","Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries\n","it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt.\n","Suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on.\n","that's not quite so so easy.\n","You have to have the right, type of shoes too,\n","that's, very important.\n","Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months.\n","but, uh, it's a thought.\n","Well, that sounds like something good to do then.\n","Sounds like something I should do.\n","nice way to start off this spring. Get back in shape.\n","Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging.\n","it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect.\n","Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, uh, keep the heart rating going, uh,\n","But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is.\n","and, you know, you can get a really good workout on it.\n","his assistants usually aren't either.\n","and, but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show, at least on\n","Not everybody has a picture perfect body.\n","well, I found that they, they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V.\n","Now, that's a thought.\n","Well, I think, uh, down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns.\n","And, I think they need that.\n","And I thought that was really good.\n","And I think if they, uh,\n","That would be nice.\n","the criminals that are going to get their guns one  way or the other.\n","I think, you know, one of the things that, that, that needs to happen is, uh, to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, buying it quickly and, and, uh, maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it.\n","But if someone's really determined to, to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place.\n","And you can get them really cheap.\n","That wasn't too, too bad.\n","Because if, if you're going to go buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, I think you, you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it.\n","You're not going to react that quickly.\n","In other words, you know, you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day.\n","somebody wants to do that,\n","I, I, at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms.\n","I do too. Uh, because it doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, I suppose.\n","A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does.\n","I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun\n","a shotgun's got too much of a spread.\n","I think it was a three fifty-seven.\n","but, uh, it's well worth it.\n","I think that, that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose.\n","In fact, I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to, uh, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon.\n","even after you wait your nine days, if you don't know how to handle it, it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive.\n","He could, he could not only, uh, uh, shoot himself.\n","He could, he could, uh, mishandle a weapon. Leave it at home and let a child get at it.\n","He was fortunate.\n","But. Now, I guess that would be a good idea\n","the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something, the cops are going to come to you.\n","I don't think you have to register a shotgun\n","Um, I, I think it's, it's voluntary\n","It's just like the, uh, the social security system\n","And if you try to do anything, uh, like, uh, not identify yourself to the government, they know who you are.\n","you know, they know so, how much money you make a week to, uh, probably your, uh,\n","They, they probably know everything from, half the time what time you go to the bathroom.\n","that's that's a little bit extreme.\n","But they could know anything and everything about you.\n","You know. And I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun.\n","Huh. And I think the Federal government is, uh, is really far away from, uh, uh, control.\n","Well, I agree with you there.\n","They do have too much control over us already.\n","Unfortunately, we, uh, we vote for the, the people who spend the money,\n","so I can't complain too much.\n","I guess so.\n","I've, I've always felt for a long time that I, I think that all young kids ought to do a stint, uh, primarily in the military.\n","I don't think it's a bad idea,\n","teaches, teaches a lot.\n","You have to.\n","I guess.\n","There's other kinds of service to the country that could be done, you know,\n","I mean, I've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time, *why no slash? not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job, but at least some of their time to look for, to go out and clean up the roads. You know,\n","All these, all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients,\n","and if they're able-bodied people, I don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and, and, if nothing else, get a group of them together and take them around to old folks  places and let them cut the yards, paint the houses.\n","we'd learn service to other people   in this country.\n","get something out of that money.\n","Country would benefit,\n","I mean, I was astounded.\n","and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy.\n","You know, it's, it's, it's totally ridiculous,\n","Well just ridiculous.\n","This is ridiculous.\n","It's sad.\n","it's pathetic.\n","I mean, there's got to be a different way.\n","There's got to be a better way.\n","But it'll never happen.\n","I mean, these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks.\n","I think, I think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as, uh,\n","And they'll help the country eventually, too, because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people,\n","and that's only going to help.\n","I mean, it's sad.\n","We're becoming a service country.\n","and now we're we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game.\n","and they, they did it better than we do.\n","because they have the ambition, I guess.\n","which is good for them,\n","but on the other hand, we kind of lose out.\n","it's terrible for us.\n","I think that if, uh, young people had service to the country might give them more ambition. Because they learn that serving other people is a good thing.\n","and, and it can be good for them, too.\n","Well, you know, you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house.\n","Parents aren't parents any more.\n","They've, they've relinquished their parenting.\n","Well, as a substitute teacher for a year, I, I can say yes.\n","I mean, that, that's a sad thing to think,\n","and that's kind of selfish on my part,\n","but you have to look out for yourself you know,\n","and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers,\n","That's wrong.\n","They do an absolutely necessary job,\n","But, uh, I mean, there's, there's a sense of priorities here, too.\n","They both have their place.\n","You know, it's just, it's, it's ridiculous the way unions have gone.\n","There was a time when unions were needed.\n","but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated,\n","and they're only there to perpetuate their own, their own power structure.\n","and, and   and that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country.\n","And, well, that took care of that industry\n","Detroit worked awfully hard on, on stopping car manufacturing in this country.\n","And they're trying to do that now with the imports.\n","I mean, you know, we've never caught up,\n","and I don't think we ever will.\n","It'll be a tough road, though.\n","and we've got, we've got to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars.\n","You know And they only did it because they, I guess they were embarrassed that they're so good at it\n","I think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service,\n","It teaches them pride in their country.\n","and pride in themselves, too.\n","They could, they could, I mean, you could organize something just within your community. same old thing.\n","That's like Eagle Scouts.\n","And that's a great idea.\n","Evidently, uh, that's, that's a big problem.\n","it's amazing, uh,\n","I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough, I mean, to be doing what they're doing, uh.\n","I'm sure, because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready.\n","And, you know, and they're being paid, probably half what most people being paid.\n","and then they, uh, poof it off, you know, do like Tarpley.\n","what gets me is I can't believe that Congress, uh, or, our state legislature can't come up with, uh, some kind of workable means to have funds for the school.\n","but. But if it doesn't start at home, it's not going to go anywhere. You know,\n","and we're going to try to teach him good values, because, you know, when, when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them, well hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what's important. Not if you can read or write, or do, or understand some science. You know,\n","that's, that's, that's bogus.\n","I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way\n","but I think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids.\n","That's the only way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for property, and people are going to throw a fit.\n","taxes right now are political suicide. You know,\n","and I don't think any politician's going to do that,\n","and the only thing, they, they would think of would be tuition, you know,\n","if it works at colleges it will work down below.\n","And, you know, that's going to, that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school, of course, which is probably the only fair thing to do.\n","But, it will be hard for those that people, that have, have in school because they have to pay out even more.\n","And, you know, it's going to really hurt the, the middle class, uh, people, I think. Because, uh, they're the ones that will probably have to, to carry the brunt of the load.\n","And most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and, and knives and everything,\n","I mean, I'd, I'd be afraid to be in school, I mean teaching, or even being a student\n","But there again , you can't hold them back.\n","and you want to encourage them, you know, to, to be active and everything in school,\n","but, uh, you know, with all the peer pressure that's going on, with all the negative things, it is, uh, it's a tough environment to be growing up in.\n","and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school,\n","So, you know, it's lot different now.\n","I, I guess what you have to do is just, uh, keep in, uh, you know, encouraging them and, and, uh, uh, try to be open with them, so that you can deal with the problems as they come up.\n","That's all you can do.\n","You got to, you got to be your child's best friend, I guess, even when they're a teenager and they, you know are kind of standoffish,\n","still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems, who they going to go to, their friends that are dealing drugs, or, or your parents. You know,\n","an, and if they go to their friends dealing drugs, they're going to be in even worse shape.\n","And, and the schools don't, don't really encourage to stay away from that, you know,\n","the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war, etcetera, etcetera.\n","They don't teach them good values like drugs are bad.\n","but, it just is amazing, you know,\n","need to teach them good values.\n","Of course, if I say this is a good value, someone else is going to stand up and say, oh no.\n","And the A C L U is going to get after them and have a lawsuit. Which is going to take twenty years to resolve, you know.\n","Well and I think, uh, you touched on it, you know,\n","you've got to start them at the home. You know\n","that's where they, that's where they get the, the deep rooted values\n","and, and, and, uh, and that's about right.\n","That's all you can do.\n","Then you just have to hope and pray that, that everything, uh, works out, works out okay,\n","Well, after you had an animal for a couple of weeks, it's, uh, you become  you become attached to it.\n","Uh  they're not, uh, they're, they're affectionate\n","Well, you don't own cats.\n","I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog.\n","You, they, they own you or, or, you know, grant you with you their presence, you know.\n","I don't know that a cat would do that, uh\n","It was, uh, uncanny like a\n","Animals have a way of talking\n","Well, that, that, that, that will make their day.\n","I, I think it will\n","Uh, I think they enjoy that.\n","For cats anyway, you know.\n","That's pretty impressive.\n","It's good to have a partner.\n","that would be cool sometime if I could, you know, work up to that.\n","I mean people seem to get into different aspects.\n","One is more of a distance,\n","and one's more, just, you know,\n","they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour.\n","I've, it's kind of funny.\n","I mean, generally in the Midwest it seems to be less, much less.\n","I mean, maybe it's because of the winters. Uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot more flat lands, you know, out in the West.\n","So it makes biking a better alternative for transportation.\n","It's, it's really neat.\n","because it really, from what I understand, it really improves your, uh, cholesterol\n","That's, that's hard-core.\n","I mean there are some people,\n","I mean winters are kind of a problem\n","it's, it's, it's, it's pretty good.\n","So it's fairly picturesque.\n","as long as you're not doing it every day, it's a good ride\n","That's, uh, motivating.\n","That's really good.\n","Uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, I'm sure, like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad.\n","Uh, probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies\n","and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have.\n","I mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life,\n","but I, I think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff I'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes, crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution, uh, and sale of drugs.\n","probably right, if you look at it from that stand point.\n","and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing. Uh, just because there are, like, crack houses, you know, on their street and stuff like this.\n","but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country.\n","Our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies and very few instances of, you know, alcohol, drugs, uh, reported.\n","However, I'm sure they're there.\n","That's huge .\n","but it, it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood,\n","so it still, uh, remains city wide, pretty, pretty high.\n","Uh, I would say the majority of it's happening during the day, uh, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon.\n","Uh, so, uh, I would say that's probably their prime motivation.\n","They'll, they'll stock your house and, uh, look at your pattern and then go from there.\n","Probably the biggest items that, uh, that you get in our neighborhood, or, would be the high classed automobiles,\n","Well, uh, the police force, for one,\n","I think they could, uh, definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use.\n","oh, right now I think, we are about thirty thousand people\n","But, I mean, that's going to tend to,\n","I mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher\n","in other words, you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit.\n","The real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place.\n","And, uh, not necessarily, you know, give in to their, uh, human rights desires.\n","Uh, I think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty, you know, in a lot of cases.\n","Course, I, I know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof.\n","Well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right, and try to get money from him\n","Makes you wish that had, uh, still had indentured servitude, for this sort of thing.\n","they've been released, you know, several times, which is another, uh, deal I hate to see.\n","I, I think that's\n","Gives you sympathy for the vigilantes.\n","I think in our, in our particular neighborhood, vigilantism is becoming a real, real possibility.\n","And that, that's a deterrent, too. If you think the home owner might be armed, right, and awake\n","that's, I mean that's certainly a possibility in, in,\n","Uh, I would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught, they're from places like up in Oklahoma, and Louisiana, Arkansas, you know, across the, the border.\n","it's not many from the local communities.\n","But, uh, it's a problem,\n","and I, I just, I think that the court systems need to be more accurate in, in, stiffer in their penalties,\n","would be a definite deterrent\n","and, and, uh, giving the, uh, police, uh, agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they, when they catch these people.\n","I think, uh, what I would like to see is, number one, completely getting rid of these victimless crimes. Uh, there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and, and worry about these things where people are getting hurt.\n","And I think one of the big things that you can do is, to increase deterrence is, uh, if someone is found guilty of a, uh, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship.\n","and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about, you know, protecting these people from, we just don't protect them.\n","and I think, I think that's ridiculous.\n","So that was worth it getting a professional for that.\n","It wasn't too bad.\n","Uh. Rollers are so messy.\n","Um, I think it was imbalance of power in the United States.\n","It's causing the lower class to rebel.\n","That's why there's such high crime,\n","and, uh, there's crime in, uh, young people because they don't have role models\n","see too much crime on T V\n","and they think it's the way to go.\n","because that's the lowest thing for themselves,\n","plus there's nobody for them to look up to.\n","But I also blame some of it on parents\n","because parents aren't parents.\n","And I think that's the basic, is they have no morals any more,\n","so they don't care.\n","You can't make parents be parents\n","You got to kind of make people want to do the right thing.\n","I guess if you gave the, gave them jobs,\n","that's another problem with the United States,\n","there's no jobs any more.\n","That would work to a point,\n","Well, that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway.\n","I don't care what you do to them.\n","so I think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in, you know.\n","Because a, a, a child can get into anything\n","Because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do.\n","That meaned she was warned.\n","But see, by that, I think sometimes it's a little late.\n","but I'm sure there's something can be done.\n","Well, for one, a major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded.\n","Well, they should start with, the,\n","if they would get rid of.\n","Seems to me, I know there's a lot about court that people don't understand.\n","There's more people in jail right now for child support, okay then there are for people doing drugs.\n","You ought to take all them little misdemeanor people\n","I mean seriously,\n","they ought to put those people to work.\n","they, you still have to punish them.\n","But don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals.\n","and they're, they're still, they can provide for society,\n","whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society.\n","I think the United States has got too many problems to be worrying about everybody else.\n","that's true.\n","I don't think there is a ready solution.\n","I don't think so either.\n","Because the economy is down, people, you know, the, the, the low man on the pole is getting more of the, I guess, the bulk of it.\n","And he's got to work extra hard just to make ends meet.\n","And they keep taking more money from us\n","and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just going to take fifty percent of it.\n","Might as well steal,\n","I would rather pay for a lottery a dollar, two, three dollars, whatever I'm paying, you know a week or whatever, and never see any of that money, than to have them take a portion of my paycheck.\n","the Social Security which probably won't be here when I get that old you know.\n","you don't count on Social Security.\n","they need to do something else.\n","Crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down.\n","And it's going to get worse.\n","if they was going to lock them, just lock them in the freezer, take the money, you know.\n","They didn't have to kill them or rape them, or anything.\n","That's awful.\n","It's just getting really ridiculous down here.\n","I wish I could move somewhere where, this, you know, you got to like in the country.\n","I don't think there's anywhere where there isn't going to be crimes.\n","Well, I think, if it's,\n","it's harder to come in there and do something.\n","and, and, and see that's another thing.\n","Neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods any more.\n","There's nobody is next door to you,\n","you don't know your neighbors, and stuff like that.\n","He's probably a drug dealer himself\n","You never know.\n","but it's nice.\n","It's pretty nice.\n","I don't know how they can live, a neighborhood or apartment complex.\n","That's what happen, that's what wrong, you know.\n","I don't think, don't rent to them\n","Or rent to them and evict them because they drug dealers.\n","Most of them are too scared to do anything about it.\n","as far as I'm concerned, I find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating,\n","and I think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now.\n","Uh, in some ways I think it's, uh, I think if anything, a lot of, um, the changes that have occurred, uh,\n","in some ways they're for the better\n","because I think women should have a choice,\n","and I do believe in the, being able to have a choice as to, as far as, what you would like to do with your life.\n","that it makes it, uh, sometimes it makes life more difficult.\n","I think when the roles now are less defined, as far as, you know, what, uh, women should or should not be doing, that it, it, it could make life more difficult.\n","There are more things to work out.\n","I know when I was working, you know, you have all these problems with, with the child care and, and with, uh, pleasing, you know, your boss on the job,\n","so you have added stresses from there\n","and then you still have all the things that, um, that you need to do at home\n","and that doesn't change, you know,\n","just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't, uh, make those other things go away\n","and the other responsibilities are still important.\n","I would like, uh,\n","which if anyone has ever been involved in that, some days it's fun\n","and some days you wonder why you're even bothering,\n","because your fighting for your life.\n","Uh, I'm, I'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply.\n","I think they're going in by choice.\n","And, and I have no problem with that,\n","but I think the male needs to be the dominant person.\n","And I think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand, uh, are not letting that happen.\n","They are very aggressive.\n","They're, uh, they almost have what I would call a killer killer bee instinct.\n","And they have to be in charge.\n","And, and I I think they lose a lot by what I call neutering their husbands.\n","the, the one problem I guess I have,\n","and maybe what so many women, younger women now are choosing to go outside is,\n","I feel that in general, in this society, that being at home is not looked upon as, um, a job in itself.\n","Um, and I think that one reason that so many younger women feel compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected, and that being home is not a respectable, uh, position in society.\n","And, there's a lot of truth to that\n","but I can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home.\n","And yet by the same token, I think some of it is jealousy,\n","and the only value I see coming out of, this is that children now in, in a two parent home, they now actually have two parents,\n","That's true.\n","That's true.\n","So, now the young fathers are having a chance to parent,\n","and I think, that's an advantage.\n","And they do enjoy it.\n","and I think that is healthy because\n","And I think it's a, a wonderful advantage for the young, for the, for the, particularly for the males, for the little boys to have, a relationship with their father,\n","and, and I don't, think you, we get into so much of the mother dominating figure, if, if the father has more input there.\n","But, uh, I don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads,\n","I mean, why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life-style when,\n","I guess I'm I'm maybe Victorian\n","and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist,\n","in that, he's a very considerate person,\n","and I think the young women are losing that\n","and I think that's sad.\n","There is that part, too,\n","and I guess we also have to examine though\n","and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as, you know, anybody else,\n","I think that's a little condition,\n","And, and you have to, I guess you have to question too, why a lot of the men, especially, I think middle age and older men, why they feel that way\n","and, and I think it gets scary for them to see change, also.\n","They've been used to being, really to be honest, in, in society, and in a way, number one,\n","and I think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching.\n","And I think, I think this reaction comes more out of fear.\n","but he has, his attitudes are very much pro-women, pro-career, which is kind of interesting.\n","I think that when children are small, I think it's okay for women to work especially,\n","there should be some, a lot more part time,\n","but I think it's, um,\n","I don't believe in this career, you know, this career drive when, when they're small, because I think,\n","I think that's very, um, unfair to, to children,\n","and even that was a rat race,\n","but I think you have to put in perspective, that, you know, when the kids came home from school, I wanted to be here.\n","so I think you can have both.\n","It's more hectic,\n","but I think you have to put into perspective what your kids need, first then\n","I think a lot of, my problem with the young mothers ...\n","Which is good, you know.\n","That's good to hear.\n","well I've been around a lot of people lately at at my job that don't have a lot of values\n","So, it's, it's always nice to see people that like each other,\n","and like families that get along with each other and like to do things together.\n","and I, I'm not quite sure why.\n","I, I think he said that he'd give her a big ring and she got married to him.\n","That's good, you know,\n","and I think it's neat.\n","which the organization can use the help too.\n","And it was really neat because they all were interested in each other and, and the cats\n","those are neat cats, too.\n","They're really nice looking cats.\n","real maternal\n","her nose will be out of joint for a while\n","and she'll hiss and growl and slap every now and then,\n","but they'll, she'll finally accept it.\n","You know, they really don't have any choice\n","I think they just learn to accept.\n","That's true,\n","they've got to keep them in line.\n","but she'll accept another cat eventually.\n","As long as you make her feel, uh, like she's still loved and everything,\n","well those cats were great.\n","oh, they're just gorgeous,\n","and they are lovely\n","house payment\n","That is a lot of money.\n","I guess I'm too protective,\n","People do it for their children\n","well if you're off, off, of a, you know, away from a road,\n","Away from a road, you know, and you keep an eye on her, it's probably okay.\n","and it's, it's just real tough on animals here, you know.\n","it gets hard, especially with the cars.\n","but anyway, we kind of got off the subject of children,\n","Well I'm sure it's been done.\n","I'm sure it has been done.\n","you know, they have all that parties for them where they dress up.\n","I, I don't think they'd like to.\n","I think she planned it.\n","but I think she planned it\n","You know, it must be hard when you have a lot of children,\n","I think I would be extremely jealous, or would have been, had there been another child in the family.\n","it must be tough.\n","so she really doesn't even know what it is to be the only one.\n","that's tough, you know ...\n","I don't think we have one.\n","I didn't know we had one either\n","We seem to, uh,\n","whoever screams the loudest or whoever we happen to give the most money to at that particular time we seem to support, without,  regard whether it's a democracy or a anarchy, or anything else.\n","But we just talked a lot.\n","We didn't actually do anything.\n","We didn't do anything.\n","I'm actually surprised at anything in Central America, along with Panama.\n","I'm just kind of surprised we did that.\n","that is, that is pretty, uh, risky.\n","But I guess they had to finally do something.\n","Actually Bush has been better at that than I thought.\n","He has a little more a little more of a stand on policy than I thought he would.\n","I always considered him kind of a wimp.\n","He takes more risks.\n","Reagan is kind of mushmouth.\n","But, but I guess most of the policy that we're using now is, uh, a combination of Reagan and Carter, much as, you know, policy makers.\n","It seems that the, the policies of pretty much anywhere, not just in Central America, that U S has now is, is, you know, more action than just words, than just rhetoric.\n","But, you know, we, we back up what we what we say with actions.\n","We have so far,\n","Of course, we really haven't taken on the drug lords, yet.\n","I'd be interested to see if we do that.\n","Well, I don't think it's possible because, even though, you know, we're against them, I don't think we can go into another country and do something about the other country's problem.\n","Well, we did in Panama.\n","We did in,  Saudi Arabia.\n","but see the thing when Panama was, uh, the, that, uh, Noriega was, uh, was, was, uh, was wanted either the F B I, by the F B I,\n","and therefore, they had a reason\n","But, to go in and take out the whole drug kingdom would be something totally different because,\n","It could be an interesting, interesting problem.\n","I don't know if they could do it or not.\n","I think you need to pick that up and read it.\n","It's quite, uh, it's, it's quite interesting.\n","It, it's quite timely.\n","But I don't think we're going to have much of a choice in either Central or South America.\n","I don't think, uh, I don't think, the, the, uh, problem about drugs is going to be safe any time soon.\n","I mean, you know, it, I think it pretty much got sidetracked with, uh, with the Panama and, and with the Middle East problems.\n","Things that, that are important take precedent, precedence over the drugs, I think.\n","I think, I think the big thing is trying to stop here on the home front\n","you know, it, it'll take a little bit of time before they'll realize that this is failing,\n","so they're going to have to go to the source.\n","I think we realize it's failed.\n","nobody,  wants to make the, nobody wants to make the unpopular decision of going in and invading,\n","We still, there's still there's still too many Kennedys and and all up there.\n","That's true.\n","There's too many liberals in control.\n","They can't agree on anything.\n","And they have blinders on as far as the policy goes.\n","As long as somebody's getting killed, as long as nobody knows about it it's okay.\n","But, but the minute it hit, hits the paper then, of course, the Kennedys and the and the and the, and, uh, the from Georgia, all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is.\n","Of course, these are the same people that also drown the Chappaquiddic, and stuff like that, you know.\n","I guess it's automatic respective.\n","Depends on how much power you have,  and who you know.\n","You know,  the people have a right to know except about what it, about what concerns them.\n","And these are the people that make the foreign policy\n","I would not be surprised if the Kennedy Foundation or some of those don't have a lot of, uh, financial holdings in, in Central and South America.\n","Considering the Kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway.\n","Every time you drink Scotch, you're paying Kennedys.\n","it's terrible.\n","But, uh, as far as, as far as, you know, Central and South America, we, our policy pretty much, uh, it depends on who we're, what government we're buying down there at the particular time.\n","I,  think we're trying to stay, uh, stay friendly with uh, the, uh, the Brazilian and, and Argentinean governments because they're producing so much, uh, agricultural exports.\n","We, don't want to piss them off and have them over produce\n","Although we do need to do something about, you know,\n","But then, hell, it's probably still be going on long after we're dead.\n","It'll still be the same thing.\n","Those people down there don't really,\n","I think it's going to have to get worse before it gets better,\n","Well, I think basically,  they can't figure out what they want down there.\n","If you give everybody what they wanted there is a complete democracy, those people wouldn't know how to react because they have no education.\n","And they'll just pick crooked people again.\n","And then people, the, the wrong people will just fight their way up to the top again,\n","and it'll all,  be for nothing.\n","It's all tradition.\n","It's all traditional.\n","They have to,\n","you have the ruling class\n","and you have everybody else.\n","And I think if you read that, I think you'll get a real kick out of it.\n","An yet I felt that I got a good education\n","I just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education,\n","and the people are, are leaving school not even knowing some common sense things.\n","So that's kind of in a higher level\n","So it's interesting that you chose that topic\n","a big difference.\n","Well, um, in, uh, public schools I guess there there are a lot of, of, you know,\n","people can take lower level courses an get away with learning nothing.\n","But, um, private school you couldn't do that,\n","you had to learn.\n","That's bad.\n","it's just incredible.\n","in college people cannot, I mean, the teachers can't make tests any more,\n","It's pretty sorry.\n","I think it's, um, some place in New York because they're having budget problems, they're closing the libraries.\n","That to me shows a little, uh, switch in priorities.\n","Well, pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college.\n","It's just a outrageously expensive.\n","I mean, you know, thousands of dollars,\n","Yeah, state's not that bad\n","and I, I think that I probably would have done it differently if I, um, you know, could do it over again.\n","and I still feel like they came out knowing just as much as I did.\n","and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say\n","and I, I feel like what I've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school.\n","And I know that I'm drawing a lot of what I learned in school, you know,\n","I, I probably just subconsciously rely a lot on, on art.\n","I think they don't value that type of student as much as you get, in some.\n","that's, sorry.\n","it's true.\n","I mean personally I would get more satisfaction out of taking someone that wasn't as successful.\n","And seeing what they could do verses somebody that did excel in, in areas and just watching them get better, you know.\n","That's not much of a challenge.\n","Overloaded.\n","I think our next car will be a, you know, some big old four door, uh, something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons,\n","and that's great.\n","I mean, it's not like I'm putting it through its paces.\n","and it's a four door which is nice,\n","but it's still a little cramped.\n","You're not going to see too many, uh, you know, green ones or blue ones or anything like that.\n","They, they put them in sporty colors I guess.\n","until, until you look at the price tag\n","and then you go, What?\n","It's like I, I guess I could fit in it maybe\n","But that, that just does not make it as an only car.\n","And, uh, funny, funniest sight.\n","And you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car.\n","you know, it's funny.\n","Boy, that's a good deal.\n","she really doesn't want to learn I guess, the, uh, the standard shift.\n","It was the craziest thing I ever saw.\n","And, and, and that's probably why they were trying to sell them, I guess.\n","But, uh, it's just kind of hard to learn, I guess.\n","You know, it's like, it's like a luxury car except that it's the Dodge Aries you know.\n","the, the thing about this, uh,\n","We thought that was a luxury car when we bought it.\n","I would think so,\n","Now, now, now that used to be a luxury,\n","but I bet on the next time you buy a car, that's going to be mandatory.\n","You've got to have that now.\n","You're used to it\n","and you got to have it.\n","And I bet, and I bet it costs twice as much as, as when I bought mine\n","I guess that's the way we were raised.\n","Turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them\n","but you know, it's interesting the two,\n","and it was probably not that bad.\n","and quite frankly, we were afraid of the, of the G M small cars.\n","And we'll probably be there with all of them.\n","You know, it's the same thing, you know,\n","well I guess they're intermediate.\n","It's like a yacht.\n","It was just nice.\n","It floated.\n","it was a great car.\n","And there is a, amazing,\n","and it's, I, it's come out as a result of the competition from the Japanese.\n","and peons bought, Ford products.\n","But just with the quality requirements that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants\n","but I really think Ford's got a ship position in this right now.\n","And I think it's showing up in their automobiles.\n","Their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now.\n","I wouldn't want to have to pay for the gas, either.\n","driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon,\n","And, it was pretty nice.\n","You got another, another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them.\n","and he's probably going to have to go to Richland a year to get some grades in order,\n","I think that would be a good idea.\n","But, once, one thing that's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating.\n","And, uh, and I, I think that's probably the way you've got to do it.\n","I think it depends on, uh, you know, what the, the cloud cover\n","but it's, it's holding in this, this pollution\n","It depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion, I take it.\n","Well, I think it's industry\n","and I think it's cars.\n","but, it, it sure, it sure,\n","I think a lot of it's industrial.\n","I also think, uh, that, uh, there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles\n","but it's mostly from older automobiles.\n","I don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting, uh, frankly.\n","I think that, uh, I think that, uh, uh,\n","So, that I think would be tremendous help.\n","On the other hand I know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars I have.\n","And, uh, that may be part of the problem.\n","it's, it's, uh, pretty heavy up here I think\n","but I think it's mostly industrial, is what I really, uh, believe is the, the main problem.\n","and, uh, uh, people, uh, I don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should.\n","I, I we, we seem to have a high, uh, cancer rate up here in Maryland.\n","Well, for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant\n","of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody,\n","and I think this state was like second this year from the top, in terms of, uh, cancer rate for just all kinds.\n","And I can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution.\n","I just don't know exactly what it necessarily is,\n","but I just can't believe it is.\n","and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer.\n","And I can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer, that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also,\n","and having all kinds of effects,\n","and who ever does is going to make, uh, a mint.\n","well that's good.\n","and that was a move in the right direction.\n","But there are more things we could do\n","and getting rid of old cars, like I said is one way to help correct the problem.\n","Uh, uh, just trying to I think be careful, uh, with the way you handle garbage,\n","Well, we need to do something,\n","we need to get serious about it.\n","you've got to get people to see\n","and surprisingly enough just handling of trash, uh, can cut pollution, uh, from, uh, uh, from just throwing it in a dump, or, or, or, where ever else they used to do with it, maybe used to burn it.\n","But that, that will cut pollution too.\n","Because you get a lot of out gassing from these things, I think, decaying and and trying to,\n","But on, on the other hand, I don't guess they're polluting.\n","But plastic containers and the like, uh, they may be,\n","Oh I think that's very important to do.\n","I, I really think that, uh, trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very, very important thing.\n","And, uh, that can help to cut pollution, I guess some.\n","I, I don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air.\n","I would hope that they would help some, though.\n","That's for sure.\n","I think, uh, it seems like there was something going on, around here, that, you know,\n","Well that, uh, that I think may go on a lot\n","and the primary reason I think it may go on a lot is just as you said, somebody happened to stay up late at night or something.\n","I don't think we have a adequate policing, uh, particularly on industry.\n","Uh, we have good policing, at least in this state and, and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too, of car pollutants\n","in Virginia they check that every two years, I think.\n","And I think that's a good idea too,\n","but I think it's a good idea.\n","And that's, that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants.\n","well if they don't I would imagine in time they'll get a law with. get around to it,\n","and if they don't then that's something I would certainly, uh, uh, suggest you be willing to uh, uh, be for in terms of, uh,\n","But I think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries,\n","and that's not necessarily the answer either\n","well, you know, a lot of people have well water,\n","and, you know, you have to wonder if that, you know could have an adverse affect on them too, if they don't, they don't get it checked.\n","because it seems, uh,\n","and, and that was some of the best tasting water,\n","but, uh, that was, that was really wonderful.\n","It was really, really good.\n","once it's been filtered an if it's a deep enough well, filtered through all the earth and everything I think that, uh,\n","it depends of course where you are.\n","A good well, though, I think is very healthy ...\n","And I support that fully.\n","I'm not sure we have the right solution to it,\n","but at least we're, we're going to the source of the problem.\n","Uh, the problem is here,\n","but the source of supply is there.\n","In fact I think a lot of the,\n","and they need some assistance down there\n","and I'm sure that, uh, as an undeveloped country they look, look for it,\n","but there is not exactly a lot of, uh, physical responsibility there. *listen; probably 'fiscal' not 'physical'\n","Very immature in that respect.\n","And I, I think that, uh, they need guidance and assistance,\n","but they need to learn how to stand on their own, own two feet also.\n","I think that for so long power financially, uh, governmentally, every which way was in the hands of such a few that there's not the middle class that we, we perceive.\n","Oh, no, the, and the poor are extremely poor.\n","but until you've seen some of those, uh, native,  Latin Americans come down from the hills, you can't imagine what poor is.\n","the, the graft and the, uh, payoffs down there are are an accepted way\n","And there's, there's a sad joke.\n","I guess all jokes are really sad,\n","it's a sad story\n","but it, uh, it is a problem.\n","And it shows the, the unpreparedness for such, such a problem.\n","but they don't have,\n","it's sort of like Russia,\n","they don't have the ability to develop it.\n","and, you know, they're very willing to be taught in many cases now, too,\n","but, you know, there's just always this kind of resentment underlying\n","I think that when they receive help from us, they want it,\n","but, they don't want it, I mean\n","It's kind of a catch twenty-two.\n","So it's sort of a thumbing of the nose, uh, approach.\n","They need it,\n","and they need to live up to certain regulations and expectations,\n","but uh, then don't.\n","Of course it's a very volatile government, uh, situation, too.\n","and I think that, you know, it,\n","they, they know that by pumping that poison into our system that that's the way to bring us to our knees, more on their level.\n","You know, that's really, uh, kind of a far fetched idea,\n","and I don't think people probably think those things consciously,\n","but it's like in any sibling rivalry\n","we're hearing the same,\n","The solution discussed at one time and I think it has real merit on the drug situation is that the the U S government could spend less money by buying the crop and destroying it than they are in trying to, to beef up the military and to do all other things.\n","I think it would be cheaper to buy it and destroy it,\n","And it would save the U S money in in the long run in how much they're trying to do,\n","And in the short run probably too.\n","And, I, I think finding an alternate to that would be very good.\n","I mean even their, even their legal crops are things that we don't perceive as being healthy now from a medical standpoint of view, coffee tobacco you know\n","but they're certainly not healthy.\n","But it's been fun hashing about it I suppose.\n","Well, let's just hope that the powers that be, uh, have time to, a little bit once in a while to, to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and I do here tonight\n","Gun control seems to be a rather, uh, timely topic, with all that's going on legislation wise.\n","I'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle, I guess.\n","I, I don't mind regulating all of the, the guns\n","and I would certainly call for a ban on certain types.\n","Now the, the wisdom as to which types, that's going to be a debate forever, I would assume.\n","Uh, the method of, of controlling it, well that's all into how much money you want to put into the, the controls.\n","and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes\n","I guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that.\n","and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it\n","and I guess I would fall more in the, the realm that I like the sport issue of it,\n","not the world's most pleasurable thing\n","and it costs a bit to do it, uh, finding ranges and things like that.\n","but it's just not like golf or whatever.\n","I mean there are other things that you could go do.\n","So, uh, I, I don't see the, the joy of shooting as, as that much of a driving factor.\n","I think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt,\n","it's a hard, hard topic, I guess.\n","A lot of people have a hard issue, a lot of hard feelings about it.\n","uh, well I think I, I guess I'd have to place myself, uh, probably seven or eight\n","and, and I, a lot of people say that they need it for protection, uh,\n","That's a big city\n","if you live anywhere real close that, uh,\n","some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and, you know.\n","About the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the, the, person was coming your way.\n","Once you're surprised, it's too late.\n","you know, the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming,\n","and had time to do anything about it.\n","it's hard to know the original intent,\n","but I, I don't see it as that, that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that, uh, yeah, it's the right to, to arm a militia and, as opposed to just the general public.\n","And you have a, you have a earn a right,\n","not just a privilege as it were if you're going to serve in the militia,\n","then you have a right to have that arm,\n","So, we change our rights with our social status.\n","but I can't see why any, uh, on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun.\n","Uh, you know, when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide,\n","but there are a few guns that, uh, just are not, uh, sport,\n","So, uh, I, I think they should have at least some control over, over those things.\n","That, to me, would not be an unreasonable thing.\n","Course, some of them do.\n","So it, it is a hard question\n","Most regulation does\n","it's very difficult to, uh, legislate, uh, crooks or whatever you want, however you want to word it\n","well, this may be a never ending topic.\n","Well, that's, that's a little unusual for, uh, for children of that age, to have both of them that age at home.\n","But, uh, I guess the activities that, uh, we have with them are, uh, pretty few and far between.\n","Uh, I guess, uh, what I see is so far as, uh, the trends, uh, uh, for children, uh,\n","And I think, uh, the big city, uh,\n","they're good\n","but there's so much, uh, potential danger, you know,\n","that you really have to watch your children so closely now\n","that, you can't let them grow up the way, the way I grew up, you know.\n","And, uh, you know, I find it's, it's quite a bit different now\n","that, uh, you know, you have to watch your children so closely and, uh, keep up with them.\n","I, I feel like, uh,\n","that it's, it's really a sad commentary on, uh, you know, a life in general,\n","that, uh, you know that children can't, cannot be allowed to grow up, uh, you know, without really close supervision.\n","and I seem, I seem to feel the same way, you know,\n","And, and, the way it is now you get a lot of supervision is, is at hand and everything.\n","Uh, the only other thing I have noticed though is that, uh, it seems that there's been a lot of or more emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with\n","there's a lot of emphasis on, on, on, on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten.\n","And, and it seems like it's a lot more than they need to know and be able to do than when we are the, when I had to go in kindergarten.\n","And it seems like it's more, uh,\n","They're expecting more or, uh, or just, uh, you know,\n","kids just because of the computer age or whatever, it just, know more when they get, you know, to be five or six or something.\n","The, uh, there there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum.\n","It's a lot more complicated.\n","A lot more available, of course.\n","so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult, I would think.\n","I, I would probably have a hard time getting through school myself.\n","or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when I went to school.\n","and, uh, and I think it's important because I think that, uh, you know, it gives him the interaction with the computer\n","because it sure looks like that's going to be you know, the big thing for a long time.\n","and he seems to enjoy it.\n","That, uh, uh, watching a little, little boys play soccer is, is more fun.\n","I can't imagine them having as much fun as the parents, had watching them\n","And I guess it's not really soccer it's just kind of a, well, kick the ball around for a while, see what happens\n","And, uh, and that was, that was more fun to watch those boys trying to, trying to kick the ball up and down the field.\n","I guess, that was, you know, as important, uh, as much important to the parents as it was to the children that, uh, you know, to get out and watch the kids play,\n","I guess one of the things that I think about is a, talking about education, uh, I kind of feel like, uh, that, uh, the, the school systems in this, particularly in this area, the systems are not under enough control.\n","The, the students have a little too much, uh, too much leeway.\n","Um, and the, and that's kind of contradictory to what I said\n","you have to be under control so much when they're out\n","but when they're in school they, they don't have quite, quite as much control, over them as, uh, as what I would liked to have seen.\n","Uh, uh, I kind of feel like there's, there's too much allowed to go on in at, at school.\n","And, uh, you know, it tends to, uh, to encourage students to not be as, you know, to not concentrate as much on the education.\n","You know, they're, they're there for a good time.\n","And, you know, to, to see how little they can get by with.\n","And, uh, it seems like it's,\n","a lot of the problem is to, you know,\n","but it seems to be getting worse and worse\n","and so they don't settle the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as, as, as, kids need.\n","And, uh, you know, that's just a problem that who knows how that's going to, that's going to come out or anything.\n","I think, uh, you know, some of the thing has to do with, uh, with the civil rights program.\n","Not that the civil rights program is bad\n","it carried over, into, you know, individual rights\n","which is even worse than them just not getting bright\n","It, it, the other switch could be the main switch itself, uh, that turns the lights on or off, which is on the dashboard\n","uh, it might be tied into the equation somehow,\n","uh, when working with the, uh, flashers, there is, uh, usually a, a special fuse that operates the flashers.\n","I should look at that.\n","that's a good idea.\n","So, that's a possibility.\n","companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all,\n","and I should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt,\n","That's\n","I think that's, uh, I think it's a little crazy.\n","and just, it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers.\n","I mean, you can't just come over to the country because, uh, you want to.\n","You know, that's not good enough.\n","You have to have a, have to have a darn good reason of, political or whatever.\n","Not a good, not a good easy way to get in.\n","I think, you know, I think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to, to protect, you know, the people who are in the states.\n","Sounds like a lot of fun.\n","it's amazing to me how, how many things they would allow to occur before, you know, you can come in.\n","But, I mean, with the new laws, it's it's tough now.\n","it's kind of frustrating, too, for those who are legitimate now.\n","but now it's a, you know, it's so strict that you can't just do that.\n","And I think it's important that they, you know, they allow a good number of people in every year\n","because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that, that we don't want to do.\n","I think, that, you know, if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that we shouldn't close our door.\n","If they're not going to be on welfare or, or, or whatever.\n","They're going to be a productive citizen Zen.\n","And, you know, I, I believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when, you, you know, send them back to their country.\n","And, I think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in\n","Well, think of how many illegal aliens have, have, have been, uh, uh, sent back to Mexico just to find their way back.\n","and that's, that's what I think.\n","That's right,\n","that's our money.\n","that's true.\n","But, I think, you know, I think all in all there's a lot of improvements.\n","I think the general idea is good\n","but, but there could be some work done in the area.\n","but, I, I don't really see any, any changes that I think of really blatant right now\n","other than I think they ought to take, you know, on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a, uh, political refugee.\n","I think a lot of times we take, you know, basically who we want to\n","because if you, if you have connections, it's a lot easier to get in.\n","and I think, you know, it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent, you know. And that it should be equal to all\n","and then not like the United States,\n","basically, it's not who you know,\n","it it doesn't become a thing of who you know, but, but how the type of person you are.\n","And it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people, like probably your husband, can get in\n","I know there's a lot of other people out there, would probably do a good job here.\n","I think that's it.\n","and I think that's neat.\n","I think we agree a lot on that\n","Well, seems to me the, one of the reasons that people don't go out to vote is maybe they're bored with the whole election process.\n","but I also, uh, think that people don't realize that their boat, vote will make a difference.\n","Uh, they feel like that, you know, it's going to go however it's going to go\n","and their one little vote is not going to make that much difference\n","Well, sometimes, strangely enough, one vote has made the difference.\n","and, and they do make a difference.\n","Uh, also I think that people have a tendency to, to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the, the more local elections.\n","Well, it's kind of strange\n","But I, I think on the whole, most people don't, uh, feel that way.\n","Or don't look, even look at that.\n","I think they just don't even,\n","I, I don't think they're conscious of it.\n","Well, maybe part of the problem is they don't, they think they have enough choices.\n","Well, that may be true, too.\n","well, not sometimes, but many times it's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign\n","Well, maybe it's a matter of, you know, voter awareness.\n","and, I think there are some organizations that used to, uh, do some voter awareness, uh, things.\n","that was not a lot of community involvement\n","and those were people that would mostly vote anyway.\n","Well, I think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long.\n","In this country, it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign.\n","and it's expensive campaign\n","and it, it, uh, eliminates a lot of qualified people.\n","Uh, maybe more qualified and, uh, more dedicated to the issues.\n","Well, the, they don't want to spend the time\n","or they don't have the money.\n","Well, it's a matter of name recognition.\n","People aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of.\n","that's one thing,\n","And even debates don't seem to help much.\n","they really don't.\n","Uh, it's it's, a lot of it is who looks the best, who, uh, who happens to say the right thing at the right time, who, not, who may not be the most qualified and can get the uh, the job done.\n","Well, that was certainly a media event.\n","he possibly could have, uh, won that election had it not been for some of the the, uh, the way he presented himself.\n","Well, he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease.\n","And so that, uh, helped out a little bit I think.\n","I was so upset with TEXAS that I haven't gotten into any more of his books because I thought it was just horrible.\n","and I don't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in TEXAS\n","so I wasn't sure how credible he was.\n","so, uh, this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure\n","Ego trip.\n","it was nice to go there,\n","but I don't know that it really benefitted mankind that much.\n","sure it was, you know, very unfortunate thing that occurred there\n","Well, you probably know a lot about it.\n","I wasn't sure that they were blaming that space disaster on one company.\n","I, uh,\n","it's a very complex, uh, situation to go into space.\n","I would think it would be harder to get up than it would be getting back down.\n","I'm sure you've seen more of them than I have,\n","but you could see where they would come off in the, how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting.\n","and, yeah, you, I mean, you actually put it on you know.\n","Well, I thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space,\n","I guess that's just to sell us on it.\n","But I'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity.\n","well, I thought probably one of the things they were doing that they didn't tell us was spying.\n","Because I think those satellites, you know, or not satellites, but the spaceflights could really spy\n","and with, uh with Russia's demise, I didn't know if we should continue to support it at the current level.\n","Uh, I think they have cut it back, to be honest with you. From, from the glory days when they did the Apollo shots to the moon.\n","You know, that's certainly made it nice for other purpose.\n","but I I know that's certainly helped a lot in that regard. Uh,\n","AIDS research is something that, that, I think whether our country is putting enough money into it\n","And they're letting, the information out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.\n","Which is scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it.\n","So, I guess I'm, I'm, I'd like to see us spend more.\n","I don't know that spending more always gets it.\n","I'm, I'm ambivalent about it because, um, uh, well it is very frightening and scary.\n","some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research\n","then part of it's lack of education.\n","I don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be most effectively spent.\n","because I know every time that something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one\n","Money from, money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly,\n","Uh, that's a good point.\n","And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two things.\n","But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh, teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.\n","and I'm with you that I don't know is, is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more.\n","That's the part that scares me, you know.\n","Which is, I think, what they also don't know.\n","I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know.\n","It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway,\n","All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know.\n","Uh, or maybe they understand but,\n","I think maybe more information should be given out about it.\n","it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back.\n","If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.\n","I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, you can experiment on me.\n","And that's what I think they're saying too.\n","I guess there's different parts of the state of Utah that, that, does have some,\n","and it's getting quite serious, as far as water next summer.\n","but this year it wasn't bad at all.\n","I guess that's because we had so much rain.\n","That's funny that, uh, we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much.\n","well, it's, uh, interesting,\n","but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it,\n","Well, uh, take off is, uh, fun from El Paso because you normally,\n","we really need the moisture.\n","I thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and uh, how many people are self serving.\n","I mean, you I, I think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt And that people aren't self serving.\n","I mean that's what I would like to think.\n","I, I, I think that the last, uh, part of that question was particularly interesting, uh, about, uh, uh, uh, can all unethical behavior, or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal uh, because it seems to me that when uh, government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes uh, parallel to the legal codes that, uh, we're focusing on the wrong thing.\n","Maybe, maybe that's what is happening.\n","Maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past, you know, ten to twenty years that, uh, it becomes more evident.\n","Perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or, you know, et cetera like that\n","and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons.\n","And I couldn't help thinking when that last it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about how many things can we, uh, actually put a legal code on that, uh, how much, uh, should it be our, uh, prerogative to see into the private lives of these people. You know.\n","that makes sense.\n","Because you start prying in people's private lives, you ruin their lives as well as,\n","And sometimes, you know, I don't even know how much of a difference it really makes, you know.\n","I mean, I guess in some cases, sure we care about what they did in the past\n","I think it gets in the way of the better judgment.\n","I mean just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician.\n","I, I, I agree with that and, uh, and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's, you know, going to the public then, uh, then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience.\n","And, uh you when it becomes public, though, it becomes scandalous.\n","uh, things that you don't know uh, do, do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray.\n","but, as soon as things do get public uh, there, there is that terrible concern.\n","it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines.\n","I guess it's what sells newspapers, you know.\n","It's a very low way of living.\n","and they certainly do get inside information\n","and, uh, of course, the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing, the more you can trust their, their judgment and their insight.\n","That's a real different topic.\n","I'm not sure I'm familiar with, with what they mean of invasion of privacy.\n","I guess that, I guess you consider just things that every day that would, you would think of about.\n","But I think it'd be, it is kind of a tough topic.\n","I think, personally, you know,\n","but uh, now I think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says, Mrs Miller, have we got a deal for you.\n","I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with, try to solicit\n","and that's an invasion of my privacy, I think.\n","They call late,\n","I think's like privacy is like, just like, not going through my stuff, like going through, just like my clothes or my drawer, just going through my stuff, basically.\n","like that's an invasion of my privacy, I feel like.\n","and at the work place, I suppose,\n","because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff,\n","and you know how it looks and everything.\n","Well, you know how you left it the day before.\n","it's, it's pretty tough that way,\n","and it, it really is an invasion of privacy,\n","I think everybody took piano lessons\n","Everybody,\n","It always sounds like,\n","but I think everybody can.\n","That's pretty good.\n","parents always do.\n","They're nice that way.\n","It's not too hard,\n","But it's not enough to put you to sleep\n","Which some of the songs on K V I L can.\n","Uh, it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh,\n","I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car,\n","I'll bet it was hard to part with that.\n","Because, uh, it, it it was great fun.\n","Well, I think, uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for.\n","They've got a lot of special needs\n","and at the same time, uh, the majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have.\n","And so you've got a real balance to make there.\n","as long as you can have the families take care of the people, I'd like to see them stay at home.\n","but it gets hard.\n","and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them,\n","but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or, uh, to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up.\n","Oh, another interesting thing,\n","I don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients, but just patients, people in general who were not as independent as they use to be.\n","Well, it, it's, it's a really, day care programs are really neat, you know\n","and if the, if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that, that is one of the best things to do,\n","but I think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them\n","and I think that's in a way it's more, some, an area where some of the day care, uh, programs have left off\n","But you can sing songs and, uh and tell stories about the old times.\n","You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way.\n","which is fine, you know,\n","Well, that is good because we,\n","Uh, some of the, some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care.\n","So it's a very, it's a very, uh, comfortable,\n","I mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that, you know, there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life.\n","Um, the bad was more apparent I think at least for me\n","because I think it affected people's lives on, in a way that you could see.\n","One, one thing that I noticed is it's very, very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden.\n","and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that.\n","Also, um, another thing that, that I noticed that was very strange,\n","Well, it would be lower middle-class housing here.\n","It's probably middle-class housing there.\n","Whereas here, there is a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward.\n","And, uh, overall I their, their health care suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower\n","and it was, it was less professional\n","and it was treated more, like a, like a taxi driver type job, then a, then a doctor type job.\n","probably the, the major concern I have is that, you know, we are leading in the technology realm of, of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to, to get into, uh, the medical field,\n","but at the same time it's real hard.\n","there's got to be better ways, you know, to do some things\n","the, the competition, in a lot of ways is, is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor\n","But at the same time, there's a, you know, they're regulating themselves\n","and, and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don't have to pay very much for.\n","and I'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they, they, hospitals buy in such a bulk rate, um\n","you know, they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item\n","and that's ridiculous.\n","And I don't think that is, that is, uh, abnormal in any means to be doing things like that.\n","I don't think it's abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all\n","And so it's, I think, to me I think, uh, something that's going to help our medical, uh, arena is for, um,\n","but I think people are too lawsuit happy.\n","And I mean things will happen\n","and, and you've got to, uh, keep up\n","or you've got to realize that, you know, it is just men or women that are, that are making, um, decisions\n","and they will make mistakes\n","there are some people that I'm sure make mistakes because they just don't keep on top of it,\n","but there are other things that just happen that you can't, you know, you can't say, you know, well, if you had just done this, you know, things would have done differently,\n","I, I think the fact that malpractice has gone up I think has raised our prices just dramatically.
